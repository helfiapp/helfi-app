# Agent Handover - iOS PWA Logout Issue

Hi! I need you to work on an iOS PWA logout issue. Before you start, **please read `LOGOUT_ISSUE.md` carefully**.

## Critical Instructions:
1. **Read `LOGOUT_ISSUE.md` first** - It contains a comprehensive handover with all attempted fixes
2. **DO NOT attempt anything listed in that document** - Multiple approaches have already been tried and failed
3. **Check the "What NOT to Try Again" section** - This will save you time
4. **Review the logging** - Comprehensive logging is already in place; check what it reveals before making changes

## Quick Summary:
- **Issue:** User gets logged out on iOS PWA when switching apps and returning
- **Status:** Multiple fixes attempted today (Dec 1, 2025) - none worked
- **Current HEAD:** accb5432 (NextAuth cookies set to SameSite=None)
- **Key Files:** `LOGOUT_ISSUE.md` has full details

Please investigate what's actually happening (check logs, test on device) before proposing new solutions. The document includes recommended next steps.

Thanks!

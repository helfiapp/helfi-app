- **Current Issue**: OpenAI API key is invalid (ends in ***0rUA)

4. **Fix the OpenAI API key** if needed
5. **Test every change** on live site immediately
6. **Provide commit hash** in required format
7. **Update this file** before finishing

**REMEMBER**: The user has been hurt by many agents breaking their site. Be extra careful and honest about what actually works vs. what should work.

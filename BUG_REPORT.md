### Bug Report

This file tracks bugs we discover so we can fix them later. Simple, plain-English descriptions only.

1) Cannot edit vitamins on Health Onboarding (Page 6)
   - Where: Onboarding → Page 6 (Supplements/Vitamins list)
   - What happens: Tapping "Edit" opens the re‑analyse pop‑up. Even if I tap "Not now", it does not go to an edit screen.
   - What should happen: It should open an edit screen for that vitamin/supplement without triggering re‑analysis.
   - Notes: Reproducible on Production. Seen on multiple items in the list.

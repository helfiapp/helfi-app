# 🛡️ Helfi Guard Rails (Protected Flows)

This file is the **single source of truth** for sections of the app that are considered
stable and must **not be changed** without:

1. Explaining the proposed change to the user in simple, non‑technical language, and  
2. Getting explicit written approval from the user.

Any agent working on this project **must read this file first** before touching the
protected areas listed below.

---

## 0. Update Insights / Add More flow (Jan 2026 – Locked)
- Health Setup must let users make multiple edits across pages, then ask **once** to “Update Insights” when they try to leave Health Setup (including Dashboard or another page). Do NOT reintroduce “prompt on every Next/Back”.
- The navigation guard must still protect leaving Health Setup when changes exist. Do NOT remove or loosen this guard.
- Warm + durable caching keeps onboarding fields (including birthdate) loaded immediately; do not strip this cache.
- Leave the current per-step targeted update buttons as-is; do not change when the popup appears or how it blocks navigation.
- Pending request for the next agent (do not implement without explicit user approval): force per-step insights regeneration to always call the model and charge tokens (no cache reuse). Only the edited step’s change type should be regenerated; do NOT switch to full “regen all sections,” and keep the current guards/prompt behaviour intact.

## 1. Email & Waitlist Protection (summary)

**Primary reference:** `WAITLIST_EMAIL_PROTECTION.md`

- Covers: email sending, waitlist flows, and related security/abuse safeguards.  
- Before changing any email‑related code (sign‑up, waitlist, marketing campaigns, etc.),
  agents must:
  - Read `WAITLIST_EMAIL_PROTECTION.md`  
  - Confirm with the user that changes are allowed  
  - Re‑test sign‑up and waitlist behaviour after modifications

For detailed rules and rationale, see the dedicated file above.

---

## 2. Health Setup / Onboarding / Dashboard / Insights

**Protected files:**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `components/LayoutWrapper.tsx`
- `app/insights/page.tsx`
- `app/api/health-setup-status/route.ts`
- `lib/insights/issue-engine.ts`

These pieces together define the **Health Setup flow**:
- How users complete their intake
- When they are allowed to use Insights
- How and when they are reminded about incomplete setup

This flow is working correctly and is considered **locked**.

### 2.1 Definition of “Onboarding Complete”

Used everywhere as the single rule:

Onboarding is **complete** only when **both** are true:

1. **Basic profile is filled in**
   - `gender`
   - `weight`
   - `height`

2. **At least one health goal exists**
   - There is at least one `HealthGoal` where `name` does **not** start with `__`
   - These are the real user goals, not internal storage records

This rule is enforced in:
- `lib/insights/issue-engine.ts` (computes `onboardingComplete`)  
- `app/insights/page.tsx` (gates /insights)  
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (data status card)  
- `app/api/health-setup-status/route.ts` (status API used by the reminder)

**Agents must not loosen or change this rule** without updating all of the above and
getting user approval.

---

### 2.1.1 Health Setup autosave + AI context (Jan 2026 – Locked)

- Health Setup changes must save immediately as the user edits each field (no exit‑only saves), and there is still no manual save button (including the “Health situations” step).
- If a user previously tapped “Skip for now,” typing into any Health situations field must **clear the skip** and keep auto‑save active.
- Insights generation must include Health situations notes (e.g., DHT sensitivity) and treat them as constraints when generating supplement guidance.

### 2.6 Goal intensity selection + daily allowance sync (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Protected file:** `app/onboarding/page.tsx`

Problem this prevents:
- When a user taps **Mild / Standard / Aggressive**, the choice must stick on the first click, and daily allowance must update immediately.  
- The choice must not “bounce back” when the page reloads or when the app refreshes data from the server.

Guard rail:
- Keep the local **touched** refs that block server hydration from overwriting the user’s first click:
  - `goalChoiceTouchedRef`
  - `goalIntensityTouchedRef`
- `loadUserData` must preserve local `goalChoice` and `goalIntensity` when those refs are marked.
- `persistForm` must mark those refs when a local goal choice or intensity is saved.

Restore steps if broken:
1. Re‑add the two touched refs in `app/onboarding/page.tsx`.
2. When saving goal choice/intensity, set those refs to `true`.
3. In `loadUserData`, keep local `goalChoice`/`goalIntensity` if the refs are `true`.

Fix commits (do not remove): `36a4ae03`, `19c75dc6`, `4fa85060`, `9cfcc278`  
Last stable deployment: `9cfcc278` (2026-01-24)

---

### 2.6.2 Birthdate picker + save lock (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Protected file:** `app/onboarding/page.tsx`

Problem this prevents:
- Birthdate changes must stick on the first click (no 2–3 click “bounce”).  
- The background refresh must not overwrite a user’s recent birthdate choice.  
- The birthdate dropdown must stay short and scrollable (not a full‑page list).

Guard rail:
- Keep the custom **Day / Month / Year** dropdowns (button + list), with a short scroll area:
  - `max-h-56` + `overflow-y-auto`
  - Do **not** revert to native `<select>` or `<input type="date">`.
- Keep `birthdateTouchedRef` and do **not** let server hydration overwrite when it’s `true`.
- Keep `saveBirthdateNow`, `buildValidBirthdate`, and the effect that syncs the parts → birthdate.
- When a value is picked, it must:
  - set `birthYear` / `birthMonth` / `birthDay`
  - build a valid date
  - call `saveBirthdateNow`
- Close the dropdown menus on outside click so they don’t get stuck open.

Restore steps if broken:
1. Re‑add the custom dropdowns (buttons + list) and remove native date inputs.  
2. Ensure each selection saves immediately using:
   - `buildValidBirthdate(...)`
   - `saveBirthdateNow(...)`
3. Keep `birthdateTouchedRef` and block server re‑hydration when it’s set.  
4. Keep the outside‑click handler that closes the menus.  

Last stable deployment: `348f9377` (2026-01-25)

---

### 2.2 Onboarding Page Popup (“Complete your health setup”)

File: `app/onboarding/page.tsx`

Behaviour:
- On `/onboarding`, if onboarding is **not complete**, show a modal with:
  - Primary button: **“Continue”**  
  - Secondary button: **“I’ll do it later”**
- The modal appears on every visit to `/onboarding` until onboarding is complete.

**“I’ll do it later” must:**
1. Set a **session‑scoped** flag:
   - `sessionStorage.setItem('onboardingDeferredThisSession', '1')`
2. Redirect to the dashboard:
   - `window.location.replace('/dashboard?deferred=1')`

This flag:
- Prevents redirect loops in the current browser session.  
- Does **not** unlock Insights or permanently mark onboarding as complete.

Agents **must not remove or rename** this flag behaviour unless the user explicitly
asks for a change.

---

### 2.3 Dashboard Redirect & Status Card

File: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

After calling `/api/user-data`, the dashboard:

1. Computes:
   - `hasBasicProfile = gender && weight && height`
   - `hasHealthGoals = goals.length > 0`
   - `onboardingComplete = hasBasicProfile && hasHealthGoals`

2. For **brand‑new users** (no meaningful data at all):
   - If `!onboardingComplete && !hasBasicProfile && !hasHealthGoals && no meds && no supplements`:
     - Check `sessionStorage.getItem('onboardingDeferredThisSession')`
     - If **not set** → redirect to `/onboarding`
     - If **set** → stay on dashboard (user chose “I’ll do it later” this session)

3. **Data Status Section** at bottom of dashboard:
   - If `onboardingData.onboardingComplete === true`:
     - Show green **“✅ Onboarding Complete”** card.
   - Else:
     - Show blue **“🚀 Complete your Health Setup”** card:
       - Text: “Finish your health profile to unlock personalized insights and tracking.”
       - Button text:
         - “Start Health Profile Setup” if there is essentially no data yet.
         - “Continue Health Setup” if some data exists.

Agents must **not**:
- Remove the `onboardingDeferredThisSession` check.  
- Force users back into onboarding when they have deferred it for the current session.  
- Mark onboarding as complete with weaker criteria than section 2.1.

---

### 2.4 Insights Gating

Files:
- `lib/insights/issue-engine.ts`
- `app/insights/page.tsx`
- `app/insights/InsightLandingClient.tsx`

Rules:

1. `/insights` must **never** show real insights unless `onboardingComplete === true`.  
2. When `onboardingComplete === false`, `/insights` must:
   - Show a gate screen explaining that Health Setup must be finished first.  
   - Provide:
     - **“Complete Health Setup”** → `/onboarding?step=1`  
     - **“Back to Dashboard”** → `/dashboard`
3. `InsightLandingClient` can show its own empty/“no issues” UI, but only **after**
   this top‑level gate has allowed access.

Agents must not bypass this check or provide “fake” personalised insights based on
partial or guessed health data.

---

## 3. Water Intake daily summary load race (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Protected file:** `app/food/water/page.tsx`

Issue this prevents:
- On first open, the Daily Hydration Summary showed 0 ml because an older fetch finished last and overwrote the correct day.

Guard rail:
- Do **not** remove the requestId guard in `loadEntries` or the `entriesRequestIdRef` that tracks the latest request.
- Do **not** allow earlier fetches to call `setEntries`, `setLoadError`, or `setLoading` after a newer request started.

Restore steps if broken:
1. Re-add `entriesRequestIdRef = useRef(0)` near the top of the component.
2. In `loadEntries`, increment and capture `requestId` at the start.
3. Before any state updates in `loadEntries`, check `requestId === entriesRequestIdRef.current`.
4. Only clear `loading` when the requestId still matches.

---

### 2.5 5‑Minute Global Reminder (“Complete your Health Setup”)

Files:
- `components/LayoutWrapper.tsx`
- `app/api/health-setup-status/route.ts`

#### 2.5.1 Status API

`GET /api/health-setup-status`:
- Uses the same completion rule (section 2.1) to compute `complete`.  
- Sets `partial` for potential UI use.  
- Reads a hidden `HealthGoal` named `__HEALTH_SETUP_REMINDER_DISABLED__` to set
  `reminderDisabled`.

---

## 4. Ingredient search – USDA data source (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Scope:** All ingredient search surfaces (Build a Meal, Add Ingredient page, Food Diary add-ingredient modal).

- Single-food searches **must use the local USDA library in Neon Postgres** (`foodLibraryItem`) and **must not call the external USDA API** during normal use.
- The local query must include **all** USDA sources: `usda_foundation`, `usda_sr_legacy`, and `usda_branded`.
- SR Legacy is the “regular foods” list. If it is missing, normal foods (like artichoke) will not show up on short searches.
- Server code: `app/api/food-data/route.ts` uses `searchLocalFoods` for single foods and fallbacks (singular/raw/cooked) against the local library. Do not remove or bypass this.
- Import script: `scripts/import-usda-foods.ts` loads USDA zips from `data/food-import/` into `foodLibraryItem`. Keep this as the source of truth.
- Search safety rule: ignore 1‑letter tokens so “art” does not match “Bartlett” via the single letter “t”.
- Multi‑word searches must match by words (order does not matter). Do not require the full phrase to appear exactly, or full‑word searches will return nothing.
- Speed rule: return prefix matches fast; only use slow “contains” fallback when prefix returns nothing and the query is 4+ letters.
- Search speed booster: keep the `pg_trgm` indexes on `FoodLibraryItem.name` and `FoodLibraryItem.brand` (they make fast typing results possible).
- Packaged brand suggestions must only use brand‑like tokens; ignore generic food words (e.g., burger, cheese, nuggets). If there is no brand token in the query, do not show brand suggestions.
- Packaged searches: use OpenFoodFacts + FatSecret unless the local USDA branded library already has matches. Single foods remain USDA local only.
- Packaged searches: if local USDA branded matches are fewer than 5, add OpenFoodFacts + FatSecret results to fill the list. Also normalize "cheese burger" to "cheeseburger" when external sources return nothing.
- Packaged fast‑food/restaurant searches must skip USDA entirely and only use OpenFoodFacts + FatSecret.
- Never add an ingredient without calories, protein, carbs, and fat. If the user picks a specific result that is missing macros, do **not** swap it for a different food; block the add and show a clear message so they can choose another result.

**Restore steps if broken:**
1) Confirm the production database is the **populated USDA database** (the one with ~1.8M branded rows). If the DB is empty, searches will fail.  
2) Make sure all three USDA zip files exist in `data/food-import/`:  
   - `FoodData_Central_foundation_food_csv_*.zip`  
   - `FoodData_Central_sr_legacy_food_csv_*.zip`  
   - `FoodData_Central_branded_food_csv_*.zip`  
3) Re-run the import (low‑memory safe):  
   `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1 TS_NODE_COMPILER_OPTIONS='{"module":"commonjs","moduleResolution":"node"}' npx ts-node scripts/import-usda-foods.ts --all`  
4) Verify counts: `usda_foundation` ~6k, `usda_sr_legacy` ~7k, `usda_branded` ~1.8M.  
5) Verify behavior by searching “art” and “artichoke”. You should see artichokes at the top, not pears.  
6) Do not remove the “ignore 1‑letter tokens” rule in search matching; it prevents false matches like “Bartlett”.

`POST /api/health-setup-status` with `{ disableReminder: true }`:
- Upserts the `__HEALTH_SETUP_REMINDER_DISABLED__` record to disable the reminder
  **for that account across all devices**.

#### 2.5.2 Reminder UI

Layout behaviour (`components/LayoutWrapper.tsx`):
- Only runs for **authenticated** users on **non‑public**, **non‑admin** routes.
- Waits **5 minutes** after page load, then calls `/api/health-setup-status`.
- If `complete === false` and `reminderDisabled === false`:
  - Shows a small bottom‑right card:
    - Message: Helfi needs Health Setup for accurate insights.
    - Buttons:
      - **“Complete Health Setup”** → `/onboarding?step=1`
      - **“Don’t ask me again”** → calls `POST /api/health-setup-status` with `{ disableReminder: true }`
  - Sets `sessionStorage.helfiHealthSetupReminderShownThisSession = '1'` so the banner
    appears only once per browser session.

### 2.6 Health Setup data source (Jan 2026 – Locked)

- When reading Health Setup from `HealthGoal` records, always use the **latest** record per name.
- Always order `healthGoals` by `updatedAt` descending (or equivalent) before reading
  `__PRIMARY_GOAL__`, `__HEALTH_SETUP_META__`, and other hidden records.
- Do not rely on unsorted `healthGoals` arrays because duplicates can exist after
  concurrent saves, which causes cross‑device mismatches.

This reminder is meant to be a **gentle nudge**, not a gate. Agents must not convert
it into a hard block or significantly change the timing/behaviour without consulting
the user.

---

### 2.6.1 Health Setup Desktop Sidebar (Dec 2025 – Locked)

- Health Setup (`/onboarding`) must show the standard desktop left menu so users can move around the app like other pages.
- When auto‑update‑on‑exit is enabled, the left menu must still work immediately; the save/regeneration should run in the background as the user leaves.
- If auto‑update‑on‑exit is disabled, leaving via the left menu must trigger the “Update Insights / Add more” prompt when there are unsaved changes.
- Do NOT allow silent navigation away from Health Setup when auto‑update‑on‑exit is disabled.

---

### 2.7 Health Setup Live Sync (Jan 2026 – Locked)

This is the **current working fix** for cross‑device sync on Health Setup (page 2+).
If this breaks again, restore these rules exactly.

**Goal:** When one device changes Health Setup, the other device updates **without manual refresh**, but **only** while the Health Setup page is open (no app‑wide polling).

**Required behavior (do not change):**
- Only poll while `/onboarding` is open and visible.  
- Poll by reloading **full Health Setup data** (`/api/user-data?scope=health-setup`) every ~12 seconds.  
- Do **not** run any Health Setup polling outside the onboarding page (no global polling).  
- Do **not** overwrite a user’s fresh edit while they are actively editing.

**Source of truth (must stay exactly as-is):**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
  - Uses `HEALTH_SETUP_SYNC_POLL_MS = 12 * 1000`.
  - Uses `HEALTH_SETUP_SYNC_EDIT_GRACE_MS = 20 * 1000` to avoid overwriting local edits.
  - `checkForHealthSetupUpdates()` **always calls** `loadUserDataRef.current({ preserveUnsaved: true })` on each poll.
  - The poll is attached to `setInterval`, `visibilitychange`, and `focus`, and it only runs when the page is visible.
  - `persistForm(...)` stamps `healthSetupUpdatedAt` and sets `lastLocalEditAtRef.current = Date.now()`.
  - **Do not** reintroduce the “meta‑only” poll or any comparison logic that blocks updates.
- `components/providers/UserDataProvider.tsx`
  - **Must NOT** poll health setup in the provider (no background checks elsewhere).
  - Only refresh on focus/visibility for general data.
- `app/api/user-data/route.ts`
  - Must keep single‑record storage for `__PRIMARY_GOAL__`, `__SELECTED_ISSUES__`, and `__HEALTH_SETUP_META__`.
  - Must order `healthGoals` by `updatedAt DESC` when reading.

**Required immediate save (prevents snap‑back):**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` → “How intense?” buttons **must** call `POST /api/user-data`
  with `goalChoice + goalIntensity` immediately on click (not just local state).
  This prevents the value snapping back to “standard.”

**Autosave guard (prevents stale spam writes):**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` → auto‑save only when `hasUnsavedChanges` is true.
- `lastAutoSaveSnapshotRef` prevents repeat saves of identical payloads.

**How to verify (two devices):**
1. Open Health Setup page 2 on desktop + phone.  
2. Change “Tone up → Mild” on device A.  
3. Keep device B on the same page and wait 12–15 seconds.  
4. **Expected:** device B updates without leaving the page, device A stays on Mild.

**If broken again, restore the above rules in these exact files:**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- `components/providers/UserDataProvider.tsx`
- `app/api/user-data/route.ts`

**Important (do NOT reset the whole repo):**
- The “last stable commit” is a **reference** only.
- Do **not** `git reset` or roll back the whole codebase to that commit.
- Instead, copy/reapply the specific logic described above, or cherry‑pick only the
  relevant changes from those commits. Leave all other newer work intact.

**Last stable deployment:**
- Commit: `5e2720b2` (poll full health setup while onboarding is open)
- Commit: `aa00b3e1` (prevent sync overwrite during edits)
- Date: 2026‑01‑13

### 2.8 Supplement + Medication Photo Retention (Jan 2026 – Locked)

- Photos uploaded for supplements and medications are **temporary**.
- After interaction analysis completes, **delete the photos** from storage and clear image URLs from the database and backups.
- Users can re‑upload new photos later if they need to update the information.

**Last stable deployment:** `75ef4f02` (2026‑01‑27)

---

## 2.9 Supplements + Medications: Brand + Name Scan + Fast Uploads (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**What this protects:**
- The label scan must return **brand + product name** (not “Analyzing…” or “Unknown”).
- Uploads must stay **fast** (client‑side compression + parallel uploads).
- **Same flow** must be used for supplements **and** medications.
- Manual **predictive typing** must be available and must update Health Report the same way.

**Why locked:**
- This flow broke multiple times. If it regresses, users can’t finish Health Setup.

**Source of truth files:**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- `app/api/analyze-supplement-image/route.ts`
- `app/api/supplement-search/route.ts`
- `app/api/medication-search/route.ts`

### Required behavior (must keep)
1) **Scan name first, then upload**
   - Scan the front image **before** uploading.
   - If the front fails, try the back image.
   - If still missing, stop and show a clear error.
2) **Speed**
   - Compress **only large images** on device (small images stay original).
   - Upload front + back **in parallel**.
3) **Same logic for meds and supplements**
   - Both use the same label scan and compression helpers.
4) **Predictive typing**
   - Typing shows suggestions after 2+ letters.
   - Supplements use **DSLD** API.
   - Medications use **RxNorm**, with **openFDA** fallback.
5) **Manual entry stays usable**
   - Users can switch between **Use photos** and **Type name** at any time.
   - Manual mode must **not** require photo uploads.
   - Manual names are auto‑cleaned (extra spaces removed, proper capitalization).
   - Manual saves still flag for Health Report updates (same as photo flow).

### Restore checklist (copy‑paste)
1) Shared helpers at top of `app/onboarding/page.tsx`:
   - `getDisplayName(...)` filters “unknown/analyzing” placeholders.
   - `isPlaceholderName(...)` detects unreadable names.
   - `compressImageFile(...)` **skips** compression if `file.size <= 900_000`.
   - `analyzeLabelName(...)` calls `/api/analyze-supplement-image`.
2) Supplements add flow:
   - Scan front first, then back if needed.
   - If still placeholder, **block save** and show error.
   - Upload front + back with `Promise.all` when both exist.
3) Medications add flow:
   - Same steps as supplements, same helpers.
4) Scanner prompt in `app/api/analyze-supplement-image/route.ts`:
   - Must request **Brand + Product**.
   - Must return a best‑guess name (only “Unknown Supplement” if unreadable).
5) Credits:
   - Label scan must use free credits so free users can complete setup.
6) Predictive search routes:
   - `/api/supplement-search` must return `{ results: [{ name, source }] }`
   - `/api/medication-search` must return `{ results: [{ name, source }] }`
7) Manual typing UX:
   - Suggestions show as a clickable list under the input.
   - Picking a suggestion fills the input and clears the list.
   - Errors show “Search failed. Please try again.”

**Last stable deployment:** `959189e1` (2026‑01‑28)

**Copy‑Paste Restore Checklist (no guesswork):**
1) Open `app/onboarding/page.tsx`.
2) Confirm these constants exist:
   - `HEALTH_SETUP_SYNC_POLL_MS = 12 * 1000`
   - `HEALTH_SETUP_SYNC_EDIT_GRACE_MS = 20 * 1000`
3) Confirm these refs exist near the top of the onboarding component:
   - `lastLocalEditAtRef`
   - `lastServerHealthSetupUpdatedAtRef`
4) In `persistForm(...)` confirm:
   - `healthSetupUpdatedAt` is stamped for any health setup edit.
   - `lastLocalEditAtRef.current = Date.now()` is set when stamping.
5) In `checkForHealthSetupUpdates(...)` confirm:
   - it returns early when `Date.now() - lastLocalEditAtRef.current < HEALTH_SETUP_SYNC_EDIT_GRACE_MS`
   - it **always** calls `loadUserDataRef.current({ preserveUnsaved: true, timeoutMs: 8000 })`
   - it does **not** block on meta‑only timestamp comparisons
6) Confirm the polling useEffect:
   - uses `setInterval(..., HEALTH_SETUP_SYNC_POLL_MS)`
   - calls on `focus` and `visibilitychange`
   - only runs when `document.visibilityState === 'visible'`
7) In the “How intense?” buttons, confirm it:
   - updates local state **and**
   - immediately POSTs `/api/user-data` with `goalChoice + goalIntensity`
8) Open `components/providers/UserDataProvider.tsx`:
   - confirm there is **no** health setup polling there.
9) Open `app/api/user-data/route.ts`:
   - confirm single‑record storage for `__PRIMARY_GOAL__`, `__SELECTED_ISSUES__`, `__HEALTH_SETUP_META__`
   - confirm `healthGoals` are ordered by `updatedAt DESC` on reads
10) Test:
   - Change “Tone up → Mild” on device A
   - Keep device B on page 2
   - Wait 12–15 seconds
   - Device B updates without leaving the page
- **HARD LOCK (do not touch without explicit owner approval):** The desktop left menu must remain clickable *inside* Health Setup at all times. Any change that interferes with this is forbidden.

**Protected files (extra locked):**
- `components/LayoutWrapper.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`

**Why this is hard‑locked (do not ignore):**
- This area broke recently and blocked all left‑menu clicks on desktop while in Health Setup. It was extremely difficult to restore.

## 3. Water Intake + Exercise Logging (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Primary scope:**
- `app/food/water/page.tsx`
- `app/api/hydration-goal/route.ts`
- `lib/hydration-goal.ts`
- `app/api/water-log/route.ts`
- `app/api/water-log/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/food/page.tsx` (exercise panel)
- `app/api/exercise-entries/route.ts`
- `app/api/exercise-entries/[id]/route.ts`

**Last verified deployment (water intake):**
- Deployment ID: `dpl_5neJtCtWrmiEAmsUtfrXceDAsBK8`
- Commit: `2bbf3b88`

### 3.1 Hydration goal rules (must not change without approval)
- **Base goal uses profile only** (weight/height/gender/age/diet/primary goal).  
- **Health Setup exercise frequency is NOT used** in hydration targets.  
- Daily exercise only affects hydration via a **calorie‑based bonus** when exercise is logged.
- Exercise bonus: **1 ml per kcal**, capped at **1500 ml/day**, then rounded to nearest 50 ml.  
- Custom goal overrides recommended goal; show “Custom goal active” when applicable.
- `GET /api/hydration-goal?date=YYYY-MM-DD` returns:
  - `targetMl`, `recommendedMl`, `source`, `exerciseBonusMl`.

### 3.2 Exercise → hydration linkage (must not double‑count)
- **Only logged exercise entries** (manual diary or wearable sync) affect the daily bonus.  
- If **no exercise entries exist for the date**, **no bonus** is applied.  
- Do **not** add wearable bonus on top of manual logs (they share the same entries table).

### 3.3 Water logging UI behaviors
- Users can log unlimited entries per day.
- Custom Entry input must:
  - Clear on focus.
  - Use numeric keypad (`type=number`, `inputMode=decimal`).
  - Use `ml` (lowercase), `L`, `oz` for units.

### 3.4 Exercise log UI consistency (Food diary)
- Manual exercise entries are created via `POST /api/exercise-entries`.
- After **save** or **delete** of manual exercise, the list must **force reload** from the server
  to avoid stale session storage (`loadExerciseEntriesForDate(..., { force: true })`).
- Deleting must update the list even if the server responds with “Not found” for stale entries.

### 3.5 Favorite label must stay consistent in edit view (Food diary)
- When a user logs a **favorite** item (e.g., “Hot chocolate”), the **edit view must show the favorite label**,
  not a raw ingredient name (e.g., “Drinking Chocolate”).
- This regression happens when the edit UI renders **raw analyzed item names** or **AI description text** instead
  of the favorite/override label.

**Restore steps if it breaks again:**
1. File: `app/food/page.tsx`.
2. In the **Food Description** block, ensure the description text uses the favorite override when
   `editingEntry` has exactly **one** analyzed item:
   - Use `applyFoodNameOverride(editingEntry?.description || editingEntry?.label || '', editingEntry)`
   - Short‑circuit `foodDescriptionText` to this value before the AI description fallback.
3. In the **Detected Foods / ingredient card title** section, ensure the displayed name uses the same override
   for single‑item entries:
   - Create `entryLabelOverride` when `editingEntry && analyzedItems.length === 1`
   - Use `entryLabelOverride` in the title in place of `cleanBaseName`
4. Confirm the “Food Description” line and the ingredient title both show the favorite label.
5. If “Drinking Chocolate” reappears, search for `cleanBaseName` and `foodDescriptionText`
   and re‑apply the override logic described above.

### 3.5 Water Intake Enhancements (Jan 2026 – Locked)
- Quick Add drink row must hide the horizontal scrollbar/grey line while still allowing swipe.
- Non‑water drinks must open the Drink Details modal:
  - Choices: **Sugar‑free**, **Sugar**, or **Honey**.
  - Honey macros use USDA basis: 1 tbsp = **21g**, **64 kcal**, **17.3g carbs**, **17.2g sugar** (1 tsp = 7g).
  - Drink entries must store sweetener metadata (`__sweetenerType`, `__sweetenerAmount`, `__sweetenerUnit`) so it is editable later.
  - Food editor for drink entries must expose **Sweetener** (None/Sugar/Honey) and persist those fields on save.
  - Sugar amount supports `g`, `tsp`, `tbsp`, clears on focus, uses numeric keypad, and must not overflow on iPhone.
  - “Add with sugar” logs **both** a water entry (label includes sugar amount) and a Food Diary entry with calories/carbs/sugar derived from sugar grams.
  - Food Diary must show **one single drink entry** (product name + drink icon + amount). The linked water log **stays only in Water Intake** and is **hidden from Food Diary lists**.
  - “Search food / Scan barcode / Add by photo / Add from favorites” should log the drink and then open the corresponding Food Diary flow.
- Drink icons must show on the Food Diary entries using the matching icon from `public/mobile-assets/MOBILE ICONS/`.
- Icon lookup must normalize labels (remove sugar notes like “with sugar”, “sugar‑free”, and parenthetical sugar amounts) so sweetened drinks still show the correct drink icon.
- When a drink is added via Sugar‑free + search/barcode/photo/favorites, the Food Diary entry must **auto‑scale macros** to the drink amount (e.g., 100 ml) instead of the product’s default serving.
- Sugar‑free drinks logged directly from **Water Intake** must also create a **Food Diary drink entry** (0 kcal),
  linked by `__waterLogId` so the water log stays visible **only** in Water Intake.
- Water entries must appear under the **category they were logged in**, not default to Other.
- Editing/renaming a drink entry must **preserve** `__drinkType` and `__waterLogId` so the linked water log stays hidden in Food Diary.

Agents must not modify these rules without explicit user approval.

### 3.5.1 Favorites + Diary Rename Sync (Jan 2026 – Locked)
Goal: renaming a food/drink **anywhere** updates **everywhere**.
- Renaming inside a **Food Diary entry** must update:
  - The diary list label
  - Favorites list label
  - “All” list label
- Renaming inside **Favorites** must update:
  - Favorites list label
  - Diary entries linked to that favorite
  - “All” list label

Implementation notes (do not remove):
- Food Diary rename flow is handled in `app/food/page.tsx` → `updateFoodEntry`:
  - Detects a real name change (not just the same text)
  - Resolves linked favorite by `__favoriteId` / `sourceId` / label
  - Updates the favorite label and renames all linked diary entries
- Favorites rename flow is handled in `app/food/page.tsx` → `handleRenameFavorite`:
  - Updates the favorite label
  - Calls `renameEntriesWithFavoriteId(...)` to update diary entries
- Rename helpers must also update the Favorites “All” snapshot cache:
  - `renameEntriesWithFavoriteId(...)` updates `favoritesAllServerEntries` and calls `writeFavoritesAllSnapshot(...)`
  - `renameEntriesWithLabel(...)` does the same for label-based renames
- Helper functions that must stay wired:
  - `resolveFavoriteForEntry`, `updateFavoriteLabelById`, `renameEntriesWithFavoriteId`
  - `saveFoodNameOverride` (keeps aliases for older labels)

### 3.5.2 Water entry edit from Food Diary (Jan 2026 – Locked)
- Water entries listed in **Food Diary** must expose **Edit Entry** in the kebab menu (desktop + mobile).
- Editing a water entry must open a lightweight modal (amount + unit) and **PATCH** `/api/water-log/:id`.
- Save must refresh the on‑screen list by updating `waterEntries` state (replace matching `id`, or prepend if missing).

**Restore steps if it breaks again:**
1. File: `app/food/page.tsx`.
2. In `renderEntryCard`, ensure `actions` for `isWaterEntry` includes `{ label: 'Edit Entry', onClick: openWaterEdit }`.
3. Confirm `openWaterEdit` resolves the water log id from `food.waterId` or `food.id` (strip `water:` prefix) and seeds amount/unit.
4. Modal must render when `waterEditEntry` is set; Save calls `PATCH /api/water-log/:id` with `amount`, `unit`, `label`, `localDate`, `category`.
5. If menu shows only Delete, search `isWaterEntry` action list and re‑add the Edit Entry flow + modal wiring.

If this breaks again, restore in this order:
1) In `updateFoodEntry`, ensure name changes call:
   - `resolveFavoriteForEntry` → `updateFavoriteLabelById` → `renameEntriesWithFavoriteId`
2) In `handleRenameFavorite`, ensure it calls:
   - `renameEntriesWithFavoriteId`
3) Confirm Favorites, All, and Food Diary labels match after rename.
4) If “All” still shows old names, ensure:
   - `renameEntriesWithFavoriteId` and `renameEntriesWithLabel` both update `favoritesAllServerEntries`
   - `writeFavoritesAllSnapshot(...)` is called after those updates

### 3.5.2 Favorites Modal Scroll Position (Jan 2026 – Locked)
Goal: the **Add from favorites** list must always open at the **top**, so the first items are visible without manual scrolling.

Must keep (source of truth in `app/food/page.tsx`):
- The modal uses a full-height flex layout.
- The list container is the **scrollable element** (`flex-1 overflow-y-auto`) and is wired to `favoritesListRef`.
- A `useEffect` scrolls the list to top when:
  - The modal opens
  - The tab or search changes
  - The Favorites “All” snapshot refreshes

If this breaks again, restore in this order:
1) Ensure the list container remains `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` and has `ref={favoritesListRef}`.
2) Restore the scroll-to-top effect:
   - `favoritesListRef.current?.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'auto' })`
   - Dependencies must include `showFavoritesPicker`, `favoritesActiveTab`, `favoritesSearch`, and `favoritesAllServerEntries`.
3) Confirm the first favorites appear immediately after opening the modal (no manual scroll).

**Do NOT change or remove:**
- The sidebar click override in `app/onboarding/page.tsx` that directly listens to left‑menu clicks while on `/onboarding` and forces navigation.
- The `window.__helfiOnboardingSidebarOverride` flag that prevents `LayoutWrapper` from double‑handling sidebar clicks during Health Setup.
- The `data-helfi-sidebar="true"` attribute on the sidebar container used for the click override.
- The background save + insights update on exit (must run when leaving Health Setup, including sidebar navigation).

**If this ever breaks again, restore in this order (do not improvise):**
1) Ensure `app/onboarding/page.tsx` attaches click handlers to the left‑menu links and calls the background save/insights update before navigation.
2) Ensure `components/LayoutWrapper.tsx` does **not** intercept sidebar clicks when `window.__helfiOnboardingSidebarOverride` is set.
3) Ensure the left sidebar container keeps `data-helfi-sidebar="true"`.
4) Re‑test: left menu click from Health Setup → navigates immediately, and insights update runs in the background.

### 2.7 Weekly 7‑Day Health Report (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Protected files:**
- `lib/weekly-health-report.ts`
- `lib/qstash.ts`
- `app/api/reports/weekly/run/route.ts`
- `app/api/reports/weekly/status/route.ts`
- `app/api/reports/weekly/dispatch/route.ts`
- `components/WeeklyReportReadyModal.tsx`
- `app/insights/page.tsx`
- `app/insights/InsightLandingClient.tsx`
- `app/insights/weekly-report/WeeklyReportClient.tsx`

**Guard rails:**
- Reports are generated **in the background** and should not run on every page visit or whenever the app is opened.
- Health Insights pages and the weekly report UI are **locked**. Do not change without written owner approval.
- The **ready alert is scheduled for 12:00 pm in the user’s time zone**. Do not change this timing without explicit user approval.
- Time zone is resolved in this order: Check‑in settings → Mood reminders → AI tips → fallback UTC. Do not reorder without approval.
- The popup should appear **at most once per day** until the report is viewed or dismissed.
- If the report is locked (no credits), the popup CTA must send users to **Billing**, not to the report page.
- Email + push are sent **only once per report** and are triggered by QStash; do not re‑introduce repeated sends.
- The **PDF export lives on the 7‑day report page** (button uses `/api/export/pdf` with the report date range). Do not re‑introduce the old JSON export on the Account page without user approval.

**Last stable deployment (owner‑approved):**
- Commit `16ed1f02` on 2026‑01‑09 (weekly report data summary + wins/gaps).
  - Baseline for Health Insights pages and weekly report. No changes without written approval.

### 2.8 Notification Inbox + Profile Badge (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Protected files:**
- `lib/notification-inbox.ts`
- `app/api/notifications/inbox/route.ts`
- `app/api/notifications/unread-count/route.ts`
- `app/api/notifications/pending-open/route.ts`

- `components/PageHeader.tsx`
- `app/insights/InsightsTopNav.tsx`
- `components/LayoutWrapper.tsx`
- `app/pwa-entry/page.tsx`
- `public/sw.js`

**Guard rails:**
- All user notifications must be saved to the inbox when sent (push or email). Do not remove this logging.
- The inbox should show missed alerts and allow users to open or mark them as read.
- The profile avatar must show an unread badge when there are unseen notifications.
- Do not auto‑clear notifications without a user action (open / mark read / mark all).
- Notification tap routing (service worker + pending-open logic) is locked. Do not change without explicit owner approval.
- Completed alerts must be cleared only after a successful save (mood check-in or daily check-in). Do not remove this cleanup behavior.

## 3. Branding Assets (Logos & Icons)

**Source of truth:**
- Logos: `public/mobile-assets/LOGOS/helfi-01-01.*` (standard), `helfi-01-06.*` (white-on-dark).  
- Favicon/PWA base: `public/mobile-assets/FAVICONS/FAVICON-01.svg` (use this SVG for all generated icons).

**Protected outputs (must stay consistent):**
- `public/icons/app-192.png`, `public/icons/app-512.png`, `public/icons/app-1024.png`
- `public/icons/admin-192.png`, `public/icons/admin-512.png`
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`
- `public/favicon.ico`
- `public/logo.svg`
- Icon references in `app/layout.tsx` (manifest + icons array)

**Guard rails:**
- Do **not** downscale from raster PNGs; regenerate from `FAVICON-01.svg` to avoid blur.  
- Dark backgrounds (e.g., sidebar) must use `helfi-01-06.*`; light backgrounds use `helfi-01-01.*`.  
- If branding changes are needed, update **all** outputs above in one sweep (PWA icons, apple-touch, favicon, logo.svg, manifests) and confirm with the user.  
- Service worker notifications should continue using the packaged icon (`/icons/app-192.png`) unless the user approves a different path.

## 3. Food Diary Entry Loading & Date Filtering

**Protected files:**
- `app/food/page.tsx` (lines ~1220-1420 - food entry loading logic)
- `app/api/food-log/route.ts` (lines ~8-95 - GET endpoint for retrieving entries)

### 3.1 Critical Issue: Missing Entries Due to Date Filtering

**Problem History:**
On January 19th, 2025, food diary entries disappeared because entries were being filtered out when `localDate` was missing or incorrect. The cached entries were filtered strictly by `localDate`, and entries without proper `localDate` values were lost from view.

**Root Cause:**
- Entries saved to the database might have missing or incorrect `localDate` values
- Frontend filtering was too strict - entries without matching `localDate` were filtered out
- Backend query only checked exact `localDate` matches, missing entries with incorrect dates
- No verification step to reconcile cached entries with database entries

### 3.2 Required Safeguards

**Frontend (`app/food/page.tsx`):**

1. **Always verify cached entries against database:**
   - When loading today's entries from cache, ALWAYS make a background API call to `/api/food-log` to verify
   - Compare cached entry IDs with database entry IDs
   - If database has entries missing from cache, merge them back in
   - This prevents entries from being lost due to filtering

2. **Never rely solely on cached data:**
   - Cached `todaysFoods` is for performance, not reliability
   - Always have a fallback to load from `/api/food-log` API
   - If cached entries are filtered out (empty array), immediately load from database

3. **Handle missing `localDate` gracefully:**
   - When `localDate` is missing, fall back to parsing timestamp from entry `id`
   - Don't filter out entries just because `localDate` is missing
   - Always merge database entries back into cache with proper `localDate` set

4. **Normalize every `/api/food-log` response before state updates:**
   - Route **all** fetch results through `mapLogsToEntries(...)` followed by `dedupeEntries(..., { fallbackDate })` before updating `todaysFoods` or `historyFoods` or persisting snapshots.
   - Do **not** hand-map logs or bypass `dedupeEntries`; ad-hoc mappers caused “all meals under Other on first render” by skipping meal/localDate normalization.
   - Apply this to every load path (warm-load verify, fallback loads, history loads, delete recovery) so category normalization stays consistent.

5. **Desktop entry menu overflow (do not break):**
   - Keep desktop food entry cards square-cornered **with** a thin outline (`border border-gray-200`); do not remove the border or reintroduce rounding.
   - The desktop entry action menu must fully overflow: parents/cards must allow `overflow-visible`, and raise z-index when the menu is open so all menu items are reachable. Do **not** reintroduce clipping or hide the menu behind containers. If you change the menu, you must ensure it still displays fully (use a portal if needed).

6. **Manual refresh only (mobile + desktop):**
   - Food diary must **not auto-refresh** on day changes, focus events, or navigation.
   - Refresh should only happen when the user manually pulls to refresh or taps the refresh control.
   - Do not re‑enable background refresh without explicit user approval.
   - Exception (user‑approved): if the last page was `/food` and the local calendar day has changed since the last visit, the Food Diary should open on **today** by default (no background refresh beyond the normal load).

### 3.4 Food Diary UX Safeguards (Jan 2026 – Locked)
- Energy summary rings must render full, un-clipped numbers after any date switch (especially Today → previous day).
  - The summary should remount on date change to avoid iOS rendering glitches.
  - Past-day energy summaries should use the cached per‑date snapshot immediately while the server load runs.
- Opening the **last** category (Other / `uncategorized`) should auto‑scroll to the **last** entry in that category so it’s visible without manual scrolling.
- Do not remove or bypass these UI safeguards without explicit owner approval.

### 3.4.1 SEVERE LOCK - Energy Summary Flash + Same-Day Totals (Jan 2026)
This section was breaking for weeks. Do **not** touch it without explicit owner approval.

**Protected files:**
- `app/food/page.tsx`
- `app/api/food-log/route.ts`

**What broke before:**
- Energy summary flashed "full calories / zero used" when switching days.
- Multiple different days showed the same totals.
- Root cause: entries had wrong `localDate`, and the UI cleared to empty while history loaded.

**Non-negotiable rules (do not change):**
- On date switch, **never** clear the summary to empty if a saved snapshot exists for that day.
- While history is loading, **keep showing** the saved per-date snapshot.
- The server **must not** include entries whose `localDate` exists but does **not** match the requested day.
- Only use `createdAt` as a fallback **when `localDate` is missing**.

**Restore steps (exact, no guessing):**
1) **Server date filter** (`app/api/food-log/route.ts`):
   - Keep the broad query (OR window) to detect mismatches.
   - In the filter step:
     - If `localDate` exists and **does not** match the requested day -> **exclude**.
     - If `localDate` is **missing**, then use `createdAt` to decide the day.
2) **Client snapshot usage** (`app/food/page.tsx`):
   - `sourceEntries` must keep `localSnapshotEntriesForSelectedDate` while history loads.
   - Do **not** return `[]` during date switches if a snapshot exists.
3) **Repair wrong dates** (when totals repeat across days):
   - Run: `POST /api/food-log/repair-local-date?tz=<offset>&mode=full`
   - This rewrites `localDate` from the best timestamp so future loads are correct.
4) **Verify:**
   - Compare Jan 10/11 and Jan 17/18/19.
   - Totals must differ across days and no "zero" flash should appear.

**Last stable fix (staging):**
- Commit: `6d7d940b`
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Note: This must be re-verified on live once approved.

### 3.4.2 SEVERE LOCK - Left Menu Clicks Blocked on Food Diary (Jan 2026)
This caused the left menu to stop working on desktop whenever Food Diary was open.

**Protected file:**
- `app/food/page.tsx`

**What broke before:**
- Left menu clicks did nothing on the Food Diary page.
- The click would only fire later (after tapping the date buttons).
- Cause: the page got stuck in a snapshot update loop.

**Non-negotiable rules (do not change):**
- Do not write the per-day snapshot in a way that depends on the snapshot itself.
- Do not keep re-writing the same snapshot while history is still loading.
- If the day is not fully loaded yet, do not overwrite the saved day with empty data.

**Restore steps (exact, no guessing):**
1) In `app/food/page.tsx`, the "Persist a durable snapshot" block must:
   - Only write after the day is loaded.
   - Never keep re-writing from the snapshot itself.
2) Test on desktop:
   - Open Food Diary.
   - Click any left menu item.
   - It must navigate immediately, every time.

**Last stable fix (live):**
- Commit: `22ef0673`
- Date: 2026-01-22

### 3.6 Food Search Consistency (Jan 2026 – Locked)
- Single‑food searches must use USDA; packaged searches use FatSecret + OpenFoodFacts.
- Plural searches should automatically fall back to the singular form (e.g., “fried eggs” → “fried egg”) to prevent empty/irrelevant results.
- If the query begins with a brand (e.g., KFC, Starbucks, McDonalds), top results should preserve the brand‑first wording.
- Search UX must stay consistent across:
  - Add Ingredient
  - Build a Meal
  - Adjust Food Details (edit a card)
  - Add Ingredient after photo analysis
  - Drink Details “Search food” flow (prefills the query)
- The search input should keep the embedded search icon and avoid the separate wide button layout regression.

### 3.7 Weight Unit Defaults (Jan 2026 – Locked)
- Default weight unit must be **ml** only for liquids (milk, oils, drinks).
- Solid foods must default to **grams**; do not auto‑select ml for solids like chocolate, nuts, etc.

**Backend (`app/api/food-log/route.ts`):**

1. **Query broadly, filter precisely:**
   - Query MUST include entries created within the date window, even if `localDate` doesn't match
   - Use OR conditions to catch entries with:
     - Correct `localDate` matching requested date
     - Null `localDate` but `createdAt` within date window
     - Incorrect `localDate` (so it can be detected and repaired)
   - After querying, filter results to ensure only entries for requested date are returned
   - Remove duplicates before returning results

2. **Never filter by `localDate` alone:**
   - Use `createdAt` **only** when `localDate` is missing
   - If `localDate` exists but is wrong, **exclude** it and repair `localDate`
   - Do **not** use `createdAt` to override a mismatched `localDate`

3. **Deduplication is required:**
   - Multiple OR conditions might return the same entry multiple times
   - Always deduplicate by entry `id` before returning results

### 3.3 What Agents Must NOT Do

**DO NOT:**
- Remove the database verification step in the frontend loading logic
- Make date filtering stricter or more restrictive
- Remove the fallback OR conditions in the backend query
- Include entries whose `localDate` exists but does **not** match the requested day
- Remove deduplication logic
- Assume cached data is always complete or correct
- Skip the database check "for performance" - reliability is more important

**DO:**
- Always verify cached entries against database
- Query broadly, filter precisely
- Handle missing `localDate` gracefully
- Merge missing entries back into cache
- Test with entries that have missing/incorrect `localDate` values

### 3.4 Detected Foods and Ingredient Edit UI (Apr 2026 - Locked)

**Protected file:**
- `app/food/page.tsx` (Detected Foods card + ingredient edit screen)

This section controls how detected ingredients are shown and edited. It has been agreed with the user and must not be changed without explicit written approval.

#### 3.4.1 Current Behaviour (Must Stay)

- The ingredient edit screen is full screen (not a pop-up) and must scroll.
- The rename box clears its text when the field is tapped. Cancel restores the original name.
- The label is **Weight** (not "Serving Size").
- Weight uses two controls: a number and a unit dropdown (g / oz / ml).
- Servings is a separate editable field.
- Changing Weight or Servings updates the macro totals and the front card.
- Editing the macro totals updates Weight and Servings (two-way sync).
- The front card and edit screen always show the same values for Weight, Servings, and macros.
- The macro section shows totals for the current number of servings.

#### 3.4.2 What Agents MUST NOT Do

- Do not revert the edit screen to a pop-up.
- Do not remove scrolling from the edit screen.
- Do not rename Weight back to "Serving Size".
- Do not break the two-way sync between Weight, Servings, and macros.
- Do not allow front card values to differ from the edit screen.

### 3.4.3 Packaged Energy Units + kcal/kJ Toggle (Jan 2026 - Locked)

**Why this exists:** Packaged foods can report energy in kJ only. If treated as kcal,
numbers show wrong and different screens disagree (favorites vs edit screen).

**Protected files:**
- `lib/food-data.ts`
- `app/food/page.tsx`
- `app/food/build-meal/MealBuilderClient.tsx`

**Rules that must stay:**
- OpenFoodFacts energy must be normalized:
  - Use `energy-kcal_*` when present.
  - If only kJ is present, convert to kcal before saving.
- Official packaged adds must store `dbSource` + `dbId` and set `dbLocked = true`
  so auto-matching does not overwrite the item later.
- The kcal/kJ toggle must appear above the nutrient cards in:
  - Food Diary entry breakdown.
  - Adjust Food Details modal.
- The Build‑a‑Meal “Meal totals” cards must stay in the colored card style
  (matching the rest of the app).
- The `normalizeSuspiciousKjItems(...)` guard must remain in `app/food/page.tsx`
  so zero‑macro drinks with small energy don’t show kJ as kcal.

**Restore steps if broken:**
1) Re‑add the OpenFoodFacts kJ → kcal conversion in `lib/food-data.ts`.
2) Re‑add `dbSource`, `dbId`, and `dbLocked` for official add items in `app/food/page.tsx`.
3) Re‑add the kcal/kJ toggle blocks in the breakdown + edit modal.
4) Re‑apply the colored card layout in `app/food/build-meal/MealBuilderClient.tsx`.

**Last stable fix (staging):**
- Commit: `a02cc1de`
- Date: 2026-01-23

### 3.4.4 Zero‑calorie macro fixes (Jan 2026 - Locked)

**Why this exists:** Some USDA foods can carry macros but no calories. That causes
0 kcal totals in the diary and in favorites, even though macros are present.

**Protected file:**
- `app/food/page.tsx`

**Rule that must stay:**
- When recalculating totals from items, if calories are missing/0 but protein/carbs/fat exist,
  calories must be derived from macros (protein×4 + carbs×4 + fat×9) so entries never show 0 kcal
  when macros are present.

**Last stable fix (staging):**
- Commit: `599b3d0b`
- Date: 2026-01-23

#### 3.4.3 Ingredient Card Integrity (Mar 2026 - Locked)

**Protected files:**
- `app/api/analyze-food/route.ts`
- `app/food/page.tsx`

Rules that must stay locked:
- **Never** allow a single combined ingredient card that lists multiple foods. If multi‑ingredient text appears, the server must re‑ask for separate items before returning.
- The client must **never** create a fallback single card from a combined sentence.
- **Weight numbers are not piece counts.** If a number is tied to weight (oz/g/ml/lb), it must **not** create pieces.
- A piece count is allowed only when the text explicitly says “2 patties / 3 slices / 4 wings” (or equivalent).

#### 3.4.4 Detected Foods List Layout (Apr 2026 - Locked)

- Ingredient cards are full width, edge to edge, with no gaps between cards.
- There is no background panel behind the ingredient cards.
- The whole card is clickable to expand and collapse.
- Add space between the Add ingredient button and the first card.
- Ingredient titles have extra left padding and must start with a capital letter.
- The "+ Add ingredient" button matches the "Add to Favorites" button style and width (rounded full, green, white text).
- The "Detected Foods: Rate this result" row is centered. The text is larger and the thumbs icons are larger. The text must not overflow.

#### 3.4.5 Food Analysis Header and Action Buttons (Apr 2026 - Locked)

- The "Food Analysis" title and the "Editing a saved entry" text are removed.
- The "Save changes" button is removed.
- The Cancel and Delete buttons sit in the top row, with Delete always red and white text.
- "Add to Favorites" sits under the image, uses green with white text, and is hidden when already added.

#### 3.4.6 Image Loading Behaviour (Apr 2026 - Locked)

- While a food image is loading, show a loading spinner inside the image box.
- Do not show a broken image icon while loading.
- If an edit-entry photo fails to load, auto-refresh the photo link.

#### 3.4.7 Favorites "All" Tab (Apr 2026 - Locked)

- The All tab must list each meal only once. No duplicates.

#### 3.4.8 Exercise Card Add Button (Apr 2026 - Locked)

- The exercise "+" button is aligned with "No exercise logged for this date" to reduce empty space.

#### 3.4.9 Energy Summary Swipe Bar (Apr 2026 - Locked)

- The grey swipe bar must not appear when scrolling left to right in the energy summary.

#### 3.4.10 Ingredient Card Input UX (Jan 2026 - Locked)

**Protected file:**
- `app/food/page.tsx` (Detected Foods ingredient cards)

**Last stable deploy (for this section):**
- Commit: `efab11b21d2f92727640012d8b662533d5e1dd05`
- Date: 2026-01-11

Rules that must stay locked:
- Servings and weight inputs show **no** focus outline, ring, or blue/green border on tap.
- Weight input clears on focus so the field is blank.
- Weight changes only save when the user presses **Done/Enter**; tapping elsewhere must discard.
- The weight unit dropdown shows **no** expand/chevron icon; users tap the unit text (g/ml/oz) to change it.

#### 3.4.11 Add Ingredient Search UI (Jan 2026 - Locked)

**Protected files:**
- `app/food/page.tsx` (Add Ingredient modal search UI)
- `app/food/add-ingredient/AddIngredientClient.tsx` (standalone Add Ingredient search UI)

These regions are guarded in `scripts/protect-regions.js` using hashes.

**Do not change** without explicit approval. If an intentional change is needed:
1) Set the relevant override env var for the build:
   - `ALLOW_ADD_INGREDIENT_MODAL_SEARCH_EDIT=true` (modal)
   - `ALLOW_ADD_INGREDIENT_SEARCH_EDIT=true` (standalone)
2) Update the hash in `scripts/protect-regions.js` to match the new region.
3) Remove the override env var after the deployment.

### 3.5 Testing Requirements

Before modifying food diary loading logic, agents must test:

1. **Entries with correct `localDate`:**
   - Should load from cache instantly
   - Should verify against database in background
   - Should appear correctly

2. **Entries with missing `localDate`:**
   - Should still appear (fallback to timestamp parsing)
   - Should be merged back into cache with `localDate` set
   - Should persist correctly

3. **Entries with incorrect `localDate`:**
   - Should still appear if `createdAt` matches date
   - Should be corrected in cache
   - Should not be lost

4. **Empty cache scenario:**
   - Should load directly from database
   - Should populate cache correctly
   - Should work reliably

5. **Cross-day boundary:**
   - Entries created late at night should appear on correct date

### 3.6 Food Diary Copy/Duplicate/Delete/Refresh (Mar 2026 - Locked)

**Protected file:**
- `app/food/page.tsx`

Do **not** change these without explicit written approval:
- Manual refresh only (pull‑to‑refresh / refresh button). Do **not** re‑enable auto refresh.
- Copy to today / duplicate / paste flows must stay instant and should add exactly one visible entry.
- Pending save queue and optimistic UI must remain (entries should not disappear while saving).
- Manual refresh duplicate cleanup must remain, and it must **not** remove entries marked as intentional duplicates.
- Deleting an entry must remove all matching duplicates and prevent “delete then re‑appear.”
- Keep the local‑to‑server ID linking so deletes always target the correct DB row.

---

## 4. Food Diary Action Menus (Desktop dropdown + Mobile swipe toggle)

**Protected file:** `app/food/page.tsx` (action menu rendering near lines ~7570-7820)

### 4.1 Desktop 3-dot menu (must stay usable near viewport edges)
- The entry action dropdown is rendered as a **fixed** element with computed `top`/`bottom`/`right` and a `maxHeight` + `overflow-y: auto`.
- Parents/cards must allow `overflow-visible` and raise z-index for the open menu. Do **not** revert to relative/absolute positioning that clips the menu.
- If changing the dropdown, preserve edge-aware positioning so items remain reachable when the entry is near the bottom of the viewport. Portal is acceptable if behaviour remains identical.

### 4.2 Mobile green swipe-toggle (must open AND close)
- The green toggle button must remain **clickable above the action sheet** (z-index bump when the sheet is open) so a second tap closes the sheet.
- Tapping the toggle must always set `swipeMenuEntry` to `null` (closing) when the same entry is already open, and should reset swipe offsets for previously open entries.
- Do not remove stopPropagation/preventDefault that keeps the tap from falling through. Do not drop the z-index class; it is required to make the close tap land.

### 4.2.1 Edit entry while add menu is open (must stay guarded)
- When the green “+” add menu is open, do **not** fire edit actions until the add menu is closed. Current behaviour closes add menus (`closeAddMenus`), then runs `editFood` on the next frame (requestAnimationFrame or setTimeout). Keep this guard intact.
- Applies to both mobile row taps and the desktop row action menu “Edit Entry”. If add menu is open, ignore the tap until the menu is closed or explicitly close it first.
- Do not reintroduce broad pointer blocking/overlays; rely on the explicit guard so the green “+” can still toggle closed.

### 4.3 What agents must not break
- Do **not** reintroduce clipping/hidden overflow on the desktop menu.
- Do **not** lower the green toggle behind the sheet (no z-index removal), or the close tap will be blocked.
- Do **not** change the toggle logic to only open; it must be a true toggle (open/close).

Any change to these behaviours requires explicit user approval and must be re-tested on both desktop and mobile.

### 4.4 Category expansion defaults for empty sections
- Empty meal categories must default to **closed** whenever the Food Diary screen loads (including returning to the page or relaunching).
- If a category has no entries, do not persist it as open in warm or durable snapshots; auto-collapse it on hydrate so accidental opens don’t stick.
- Categories with entries should preserve the user’s last choice; do not auto-close them unless the user explicitly closes them.
   - Timezone handling must be correct
   - Date filtering must account for user's timezone

### 3.6 Mobile Category “+” Toggles (Locked)

The green “+” buttons for each Food Diary category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, Other) are a **strict toggle**:
- Tap the “+” to open the add panel for that category.
- Tap the **same “+” again** to close it.
- Do **not** change this to “tap outside to close” or any other behaviour.
- The “Other/+” panel must remain scrollable so all options are reachable on mobile.

### 3.7 Food Diary Manual Refresh Only (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Protected file:**
- `app/food/page.tsx`

**Guard rails:**
- Do **not** auto‑refresh when:
  - The user changes the diary date.
  - The tab regains focus.
  - The page becomes visible again.
- Refreshing should happen **only** when the user manually pulls down (pull‑to‑refresh) or taps the refresh button.
- Do not re‑enable background refresh without explicit user approval.
- **Auto-scroll is required on mobile:** when a category “+” is opened, scroll that category row into view (without covering or moving the “+”) so the entire add panel is visible. Do not remove or alter this scroll behavior.

### 3.7 Food Diary Deletes & Snapshot Sync (Dec 2025 – Locked)
- Deletion must also clear/sync the “today’s foods” snapshot so stale cards cannot reappear:
  - Keep `/api/user-data/clear-todays-foods` intact; do not remove or bypass it.
  - In `app/food/page.tsx`, after deleting an entry, continue posting the updated (or empty) `todaysFoods` to `/api/user-data` (or call the clear endpoint when empty). Do **not** remove this server-sync step.
  - Do not reintroduce local-only deletes that skip the server snapshot; fixes were for entries resurrecting after refresh.
- **Backfill safeguard (Jan 2026):** If the client has local entries for a day but `/api/food-log` returns zero rows, the UI now backfills those entries into `FoodLog` so deletes have real IDs and don’t 404. Do **not** remove this backfill step; it is required to keep saves/deletes reliable when the server is temporarily empty.
- **Favorites and write guards (Dec 2025):** `/api/user-data` must not overwrite favorites with an empty array; it logs `AGENT_DEBUG favorites write` and skips empty wipes. Do not remove this guard or the logging.
- **Server-side dedupe (Dec 2025):** `/api/food-log` dedupes on write (blocks near-identical duplicates within a short window) and the All tab filters out stale/corrupt entries (only recent valid rows). Do not remove these protections without approval.

#### 3.7.1 Persistent/Sticky Entry Playbook (Dec 2025 incident)
- Root cause observed: entries saved with mismatched `localDate` vs `createdAt` leak across adjacent days; client warm cache can keep showing the card even after server delete.
- Protections in place (do not remove):
  - Saves anchor both `createdAt` and `localDate` to the selected date.
  - GET `/api/food-log` auto-heals: if `createdAt` matches the requested day but `localDate` differs, it rewrites `localDate` to the correct day.
  - Delete sweep: tries ID first, then description+category across multiple dates (entry date, localDate, selected date, today, ±1, ±2) with a deduped list.
- If a “stuck” entry appears:
  1) Run a server-signed delete using the browser console (logged-in session):
     - Fetch matching rows and delete by id, then run description delete across the affected dates. Example:
       ```js
       (async () => {
         const desc = 'A burger with a sesame seed bun, two beef patties, cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.';
         const category = 'dinner';
         const dates = ['2025-12-06','2025-12-07','2025-12-08']; // adjust as needed
         const tz = new Date().getTimezoneOffset();
         const all = [];
         for (const date of dates) {
           const res = await fetch(`/api/food-log?date=${date}&tz=${tz}`);
           const json = await res.json();
           (json.logs || []).forEach(l => all.push({date, id: l.id, localDate: l.localDate, createdAt: l.createdAt, meal: l.meal || l.category, desc: l.description?.slice(0,120)}));
         }
         const matches = all.filter(l => (l.desc || '').toLowerCase().includes('burger with a sesame seed bun') && (l.meal || '').toLowerCase() === category);
         console.log('Matches found:', matches);
         for (const m of matches) {
           const r = await fetch('/api/food-log/delete', { method: 'POST', headers: {'Content-Type':'application/json'}, body: JSON.stringify({ id: m.id }) });
           console.log('delete by id', m.id, m.date, r.status, await r.text());
         }
         const sweep = await fetch('/api/food-log/delete-by-description', {
           method: 'POST',
           headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
           body: JSON.stringify({ description: desc, category, dates }),
         });
         console.log('delete-by-description', sweep.status, await sweep.text());
         for (const date of dates) {
           const res = await fetch(`/api/food-log?date=${date}&tz=${tz}`);
           const json = await res.json();
           console.log('After delete check', date, (json.logs || []).length, json.logs || []);
         }
       })();
       ```
  2) Clear client warm/durable cache and reload to drop stale cards:
     ```js
     localStorage.removeItem('foodDiary:warmState');
     sessionStorage.removeItem('foodDiary:warmState');
     location.reload();
     ```
  3) Re-check the affected dates (same script as above) and confirm zero rows.
- Do not weaken any of the protections above (anchored saves, auto-heal, multi-date delete sweep, cache clear + reload).

### 3.7.2 Food Diary Restore & Favorites Recovery (Jan 2026 - Locked)

**Purpose:** If the diary shows zero data, favorites/custom meals vanish, or credits look wrong.

**Guard rails (do not remove):**
- Local device restore is **best-effort** and must stay **user-controlled**. Hide only after a successful restore or an explicit “hide” click.
- Do **not** clear local diary snapshots unless the user explicitly asks; they are the last-resort safety net.
- Support recovery routes must always require **identity verification** via a support ticket.
- Restore banner is currently disabled via `SHOW_LOCAL_RESTORE_PROMPT = false` in `app/food/page.tsx`. Flip to `true` only if the owner asks to re-enable.
- The "Fix favorites & credits" banner is also disabled via `SHOW_FAVORITES_RESCUE_PROMPT = false` in `app/food/page.tsx`. Flip to `true` only if the owner asks.

**If it breaks, restore in this order (do not improvise):**
1) Confirm the server still has food log data for the date.
2) Run `POST /api/support/account-repair` (repairs credits/subscription, fixes bad dates, restores favorites from backup if available).
3) If favorites/custom meals are still missing, run `POST /api/support/favorites-rebuild` (backs up then rebuilds from recent food logs).
4) If a single favorite is missing, run `POST /api/support/favorite-restore` with the label. If not found, use `POST /api/support/favorite-create` and re-add ingredients manually.
5) Use the local “Restore this day / Restore all days” banner in Food Diary to bring back device-only entries.

**Protected files:**
- `app/food/page.tsx` (local restore banner + hide flag)
- `app/api/support/account-repair/route.ts`
- `app/api/support/favorites-rebuild/route.ts`
- `app/api/support/favorite-restore/route.ts`
- `app/api/support/favorite-create/route.ts`

### 3.8 Ingredient Card Summary Filtering (Dec 2025 – Locked)
- In `app/food/page.tsx`, keep the guard that strips generic “plate/meal” summary items when multiple ingredients exist (e.g., “The image shows…”, long “burger with …” phrases). Do not remove or relax this filter without approval.
- Ingredient cards for multi-item meals must remain one per distinct ingredient; do not reintroduce plate-level summary cards into the list.

### 3.9 Portion Sync & Burger Defaults (Dec 2025 – Locked)
- **Files:** `app/food/page.tsx`, `app/api/analyze-food/route.ts`.
- Do NOT change servings/pieces/weight sync logic. Servings and pieces must stay in lockstep, and weight must derive from per-serving weight (including `piecesPerServing` defaults). If you switch portion modes, weight must seed from the current servings; changing weight must back-calculate servings/pieces.
- Do NOT weaken per-piece defaults for patties/cheese/bacon/eggs (115g ~250 kcal patty; realistic slice weights). Do NOT drop `piecesPerServing` seeding or numeric normalization of counts.
- Do NOT change the discrete steps (servings step = 1 / piecesPerServing) or make pieces non-integer.
- Do NOT loosen the “be daring” guessing rule in the analyze-food prompt: it must keep scanning edges/corners and include plausible side items (e.g., breads/rolls/bagels) as `isGuess: true` when uncertain. This applies to all meals, not just burgers.
- Do NOT enlarge the analyzed photo on desktop; keep the compact square preview sizing. Category “+” menu must remain visible/not covered.
- Any change requires explicit written approval from the user and must be tested live with the burger photo flow: pieces default to the detected count, servings step 1/N, weight sync both directions, realistic kcal/grams.

### 3.10 Discrete Produce Counts & Weight Seeding (Jan 2026 – Locked)
- **Files:** `app/food/page.tsx` — especially `parseCountFromFreeText`, `piecesMultiplierForServing`, `estimateGramsPerServing`, `getBaseWeightPerServing`, `applyStructuredItems` (weight seeding block), UI serving/weight display around lines ~6700-7050.
- Do NOT remove or weaken the rule that when `piecesPerServing > 1`, serving weight and display label must scale to *all* pieces (e.g., “6 medium (200g each)” and weight ≈ 6× per-piece grams). No reversion to per-piece weights or labels.
- Do NOT bypass `piecesMultiplierForServing` or the weight reseed in `applyStructuredItems`; both must remain to override per-piece seeds from `serving_size` text like “1 medium (200g)”.
- Do NOT change the serving/weight UI text that shows combined serving size and total amount for discrete items; pieces stay integer, servings stay 1 base.
- **Unit default guard (Jan 2026):** Weight units must default to grams for non‑liquid foods even if a serving label uses `ml`; only clear liquids (milk, oil, juice, etc.) should default to `ml`.
- Any modification to discrete counts, serving labels, or weight seeding requires explicit user approval and must be retested with multi-piece produce (e.g., 6 carrots/zucchinis) to confirm pieces, labels, and weights all reflect the full set.

### 3.11 Admin Credit Grants & Meter (Jan 2026 – Locked)
- **Files:** `app/api/admin/user-management/route.ts`, `app/api/credit/status/route.ts`, `lib/credit-system.ts`, `components/UsageMeter.tsx`.
- Admin “Add Credits” must post to `/api/admin/user-management` and increment `additionalCredits` directly (non-expiring). Do NOT revert to expiring top-ups for admin grants without explicit user approval.
- `/api/credit/status` must always include `additionalAvailableCents` and add it to `totalAvailableCents`; meter/UI must reflect the sum of subscription remaining + active top-ups + additional credits. Do NOT drop additional credits from the meter.
- Admin user list must surface `totalAvailableCredits` including additional credits (not just top-ups); do not change this aggregation without approval.
- Any billing/credit change requires explicit user approval and retesting on a Premium account with admin-added credits to confirm the meter and admin modal both show the added amount immediately.

### 3.12 AI Recommended Meals (Jan 2026 – Locked)
- **Files:** `app/food/recommended/RecommendedMealClient.tsx`, `app/food/page.tsx`, `app/api/ai-meal-recommendation/route.ts`.
- The Recommended Meal screen must always open on the **Generate** button (no auto-show of the last meal). The Food Diary “Recommended” action passes a `fresh=<timestamp>` query to force a reset. Do not remove this.
- Saved AI meals must show **Recipe** and **Reason** tabs in the Food Diary:
  - On save, the meal stores metadata in `nutrition`: `__origin: 'ai-recommended'`, `__aiRecipe`, `__aiWhy`, and `__aiMealId`.
  - For older saves with no metadata, the diary fetches AI history from `/api/ai-meal-recommendation?date&category` (stored under `AI_MEAL_RECOMMENDATION_GOAL_NAME`) and matches by id/name/items.
- Do not strip or overwrite these fields or the fallback matching logic; the tabs depend on them.

### 3.13 Build a Meal portion scaling (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Protected files:**
- `app/food/build-meal/MealBuilderClient.tsx`
- `app/food/page.tsx`

Problem this prevents:
- Changing **Portion size** must scale the meal totals correctly (including sizes **larger** than the full recipe).
- The Food Diary daily totals must use the same scaled values.

Guard rail:
- Do not clamp `portionScale` to 1.0 for saved meals. Portions can be **less than or greater than** 1.
- Keep `__portionScale` on saved meals so the diary can scale totals later.
- Daily totals must apply `applyPortionScaleToTotals(...)` when `__portionScale` exists.
- `getEntryPortionScale` in `app/food/page.tsx` must allow values **greater than 1**. Do not ignore or clamp them.

Restore steps if broken:
1. In `MealBuilderClient`, restore `portionScale` calculation and make sure totals for save are multiplied by it.
2. Ensure saved meals keep `__portionScale` in their totals.
3. In `app/food/page.tsx`, apply `applyPortionScaleToTotals(...)` when calculating entry totals.
4. In `app/food/page.tsx`, ensure `getEntryPortionScale` accepts values above 1 (not just below 1).

Fix commit: `0347b9c7` (2026-01-23)  
Last stable deployment: `0347b9c7` (2026-01-23)

## 4. Macros Progress Bars & Remaining Calories Ring (Locked)

The macros progress bars and remaining calories ring in the Food Diary are now working perfectly and must **not be changed** unless the user explicitly requests modifications.

### 4.1 Protected Components

**Protected files:**
- `app/food/page.tsx` (lines ~265-353 – `TargetRing` component for remaining calories)
- `app/food/page.tsx` (lines ~4867-4901 – macros progress bars rendering)
- `components/SolidMacroRing.tsx` (solid macro ring component, if used elsewhere)

### 4.2 Macros Progress Bars

**Location:** `app/food/page.tsx` lines ~4867-4901, within the "Energy summary" section

**Current Behaviour (Must Stay):**

Each macro (Protein, Carbs, Fat, Fibre, Sugar) displays:
1. **Label and values:**
   - Macro name (e.g., "Protein")
   - Consumed / Target format (e.g., "50 / 100 g")
   - Remaining amount in colored text (e.g., "50 g left")
   - Percentage display (e.g., "50%")
2. **Progress bar:**
   - Horizontal bar showing consumed percentage
   - Bar color matches macro color (Protein: red, Carbs: green, Fat: purple, Fibre: cyan, Sugar: orange)
   - Bar turns red (`#ef4444`) when over target (100%+)
   - Bar width is clamped to maximum 100% visually
3. **Calculation logic:**
   - `pctRaw = consumed / target` (can exceed 1.0 when over target)
   - `pct = Math.max(0, pctRaw)` (ensures non-negative)
   - `percentDisplay = Math.round(pctRaw * 100)` (for percentage text)
   - `remaining = Math.max(0, target - consumed)` (never negative)
   - Bar width uses `Math.min(100, pct * 100)` to cap visual display at 100%

**What Agents MUST NOT Do:**
- Change the progress bar color scheme or remove the "over target" red color
- Modify the calculation logic for percentage or remaining amounts
- Remove or change the format of the "consumed / target" display
- Change the order of macros (Protein, Carbs, Fat, Fibre, Sugar)
- Remove the "left" text showing remaining amounts
- Change the bar height (`h-2`) or styling
- Remove the percentage display or change its format

### 4.3 Remaining Calories Ring

**Location:** `app/food/page.tsx` lines ~265-353 (`TargetRing` component), rendered at lines ~4904-4937

**Current Behaviour (Must Stay):**

The remaining calories ring displays:
1. **Two-tone ring visualization:**
   - Green circle (`#22c55e`) representing remaining allowance (full circle)
   - Red overlay (`#ef4444`) representing consumed amount (overlays from top, grows clockwise)
   - Ring rotates -90 degrees so it starts from top
   - Stroke width: 8px
   - Responsive sizing: 144px on mobile, 132px on desktop
2. **Center display:**
   - Main value: remaining calories/kJ (e.g., "1,200 kcal" or "5,000 kJ")
   - Unit displayed below value
   - Label "Remaining" below the ring
3. **Supporting information:**
   - "Daily allowance: X kcal/kJ" text below ring
   - Legend showing:
     - Red dot + "Used" (what's been consumed)
     - Green dot + "Remaining" (what's left)
4. **Calculation logic:**
   - `percent` parameter is the *used* fraction (0–1), where 1.0 = 100% consumed
   - `usedFraction = Math.max(0, Math.min(percent, 1))` (clamped to 0–1)
   - `usedLength = usedFraction * circumference` (for red overlay)
   - Remaining value: `Math.max(0, target - consumed)` in selected unit (kcal/kJ)
   - Unit toggle (kcal/kJ) switches between energy units

**What Agents MUST NOT Do:**
- Change the two-tone ring design (green base + red overlay)
- Modify the ring colors (`#22c55e` green, `#ef4444` red)
- Change the ring rotation or starting position
- Remove or modify the center value display format
- Change the stroke width (8px) or ring dimensions
- Remove the "Daily allowance" text or legend
- Modify the calculation logic for remaining calories
- Remove the kcal/kJ unit toggle functionality
- Change the responsive sizing behavior

### 4.4 Energy Summary Section Layout

**Location:** `app/food/page.tsx` lines ~4830-4940

**Current Layout (Must Stay):**
- Desktop: Grid layout with macros progress bars on left, remaining calories ring on right
- Mobile: Stacked layout with remaining calories ring on top, macros progress bars below
- Header shows "Today's energy summary" or "Energy summary" with kcal/kJ toggle
- Energy summary stays visible even when no meals are added (targets show with 0 used)

**What Agents MUST NOT Do:**
- Change the responsive layout behavior (grid on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- Remove the energy unit toggle (kcal/kJ)
- Modify the section header text or styling
- Change the order of elements (ring vs progress bars)
- Hide the Energy summary until a meal is added

### 4.5 Testing Requirements

Before modifying macros progress bars or remaining calories ring, agents must test:
1. **Normal consumption:** Values below target show correct percentages and green bars
2. **Over target:** Values exceeding target show red bars and correct "over 100%" display
3. **Zero consumption:** Empty diary shows 0% bars and full green ring
4. **Unit switching:** kcal/kJ toggle updates both ring value and daily allowance text
5. **Responsive design:** Layout switches correctly between mobile and desktop views
6. **Multiple macros:** All five macros (Protein, Carbs, Fat, Fibre, Sugar) display correctly

## 3.8 Food Diary Photo Storage (Dec 2025 – locked)

Food diary photos now live in **Vercel Blob** and must not be stored in Neon.

**Protected files:**
- `app/api/food-log/route.ts`
- `app/api/food-log/delete/route.ts`
- `app/api/food-log/delete-atomic/route.ts`
- `app/api/food-log/delete-by-description/route.ts`
- `app/api/cron/food-photo-cleanup/route.ts`
- `lib/food-photo-storage.ts`
- `vercel.json` (daily cleanup cron)

**Rules that must stay:**
- `imageUrl` stored in `FoodLog` is always a **remote Blob URL** (no base64 stored long-term).
- When a diary entry is deleted, its photo is deleted **immediately** if no other entry still uses it.
- A daily cleanup job removes photos older than the retention window and clears `imageUrl`.
- Retention is controlled by `FOOD_PHOTO_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 7). Do not change the default without approval.
- If Blob storage is not configured, the system must fail softly (do not break saving entries).

**Why locked:**
- Prevents database bloat in Neon.
- Keeps storage costs predictable while preserving nutrition data.

## 5. AI Food Analyzer & Credit/Billing System (Critical Lock)

These flows have been broken repeatedly by past agents. The current behaviour
is working and must be treated as **locked** unless the user explicitly asks
for a change.

### 4.1 Protected Files (AI Food Analyzer & Credits)

- `app/food/page.tsx` (entire file – Food Analyzer UI + diary + AI flow)
- `app/api/analyze-food/route.ts` (Food Analyzer backend / OpenAI calls)
- `lib/credit-system.ts` (`CreditManager` and credit charging logic)
- `app/api/credit/status/route.ts` (credits remaining bar – wallet status)
- `app/api/credit/feature-usage/route.ts` (“This AI feature has been used X times…”)
- `app/api/credit/feature-usage-stats/route.ts` (Billing page “Your usage” time-range stats)
- `app/api/credit/usage-breakdown/route.ts` (admin/diagnostic usage breakdown)

### 5.1 Billing Page AI Feature Credit Costs (Jan 2026 - Locked)

- The "AI feature credit costs" box on the Billing page is display-only, but it must match real charges.
- Source of truth for this display list: `data/creditCosts.ts` (used by `app/billing/page.tsx`).
- Do not change labels or numbers without the owner's written approval.
- After any approved change, verify the Billing page shows the correct numbers and they match actual charges.
- Last stable deployment: `ad684039` (2026-01-24)
- **Food image freshness + curated USDA enforcement (Dec 2025):**
  - `app/api/analyze-food/route.ts` still hashes images, but **food photo analysis and barcode label scans must pass `forceFresh`** so each analysis is new. Do not re-enable cached reuse for these scans without explicit user approval.
  - `app/food/page.tsx` enriches common items (bun, patty, cheese, ketchup, etc.) with curated USDA-backed macros, enforces realistic floors, and normalizes names (e.g., “Burger bun” instead of random variants). Do not weaken or remove this enrichment/normalization.
- “Never wipe ingredient cards” guard: `applyStructuredItems` must not replace existing cards with an empty list if a new analysis yields nothing. Preserve existing items and totals in that case. **Do not change this behaviour or clear `analyzedItems` / `analyzedTotal` in new flows without explicit written approval from the user. If ingredient cards ever disappear after a photo or text re‑analysis, treat that as a critical bug and restore this guard – do NOT redefine the UX.**
  - Intent: keep macros realistic (~6 oz patty ~450 kcal) and totals consistent across repeated analyses of the same image; preserve cards at all times.
- **Strict AI-only ingredient cards (Dec 2025 – locked):**
  - Ingredient cards must come from AI‑generated structured items only. Do **not** create placeholder cards or extract cards from prose descriptions on the client.
  - If ingredients are missing, the backend must re‑ask the AI to output the missing items (AI‑only follow‑up). Do not backfill cards locally.
- **Analysis speed and cost control (Apr 2026 - locked):**
  - Stop after one good follow-up. If valid items exist, do not chain extra AI calls.
  - Avoid multi-step follow-ups that increase time or credits unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Health warning alternatives (Mar 2026 - locked):**
  - When a health warning is triggered, show 2–3 plain‑language alternative meal ideas with short recipes in the Food Analyzer UI.
  - Alternatives must avoid the ingredients/issues named in the warning and should use the low‑cost model to keep usage minimal.
- **Food photo model defaults + component-bound follow-up (Dec 25, 2025 – locked):**
  - Food photo analysis defaults to `gpt-4o` for speed and accuracy. Do not revert image analysis to `gpt-5.2` by default.
  - Packaged/label OCR keeps `gpt-5.2` for per‑serve accuracy; do not downgrade label scans.
  - The component‑bound vision follow‑up must remain: one ingredient card per listed component, no summary card, no uniform “100 g” defaults.
- **Do not undo the discrete-portion fix (Nov 22, 2025):**
  - `app/food/page.tsx` now *scales macros instead of servings* for discrete items when the label states multiple pieces (e.g., “3 large eggs”, “4 slices bacon”). Servings stays at `1` to avoid “3 servings of 3 eggs”, while calories/macros are multiplied by the labeled count. **Leave this logic intact** unless the user explicitly requests a different design.
- **Pieces only when explicitly counted (Dec 2025 – locked):**
  - In `app/api/analyze-food/route.ts`, only set `pieces` / `piecesPerServing` when the item name or serving size explicitly shows a count (e.g., “1 egg”, “3 strips bacon”, “4 sausages”).  
  - If a clear count is not visible, default to grams/serving size and **do not** show pieces in the ingredient card.
  - This applies to meal photo analysis and text-based analysis alike; do not reintroduce inferred piece counts without user approval.
- **Keep bagel starter data intact:** `data/foods-starter.ts` includes `Sesame Bagel` with standard macros so photo analyses have a reliable fallback. Do not remove or rename this entry without approval.
- **Packaged per-serving OCR (Nov 24, 2025 – locked):**
  - Packaged (“Product nutrition image”) must use **only the per-serving column** from the label; ignore per-100g.
  - Do not sum saturated/trans into total fat. If macros overshoot label calories, only clamp fat (and carbs if clearly under-read) to fit label kcal; otherwise keep the per-serving numbers from the label.
  - Barcode mode is **removed**; do not reintroduce barcode lookups or hallucinated products. If nothing is found, stick to label OCR.
- **Barcode label scan accuracy (Dec 2025 – locked):**
  - Barcode label scans must read **ONLY the first per-serve column** on the label. Never use the per-100g column.
  - If the per-serve values are unclear or do not fit the serving size, block saving and show the red warning. Do not allow silent saves.
  - The warning must include the **Edit label numbers** action so users can correct values.
  - For label scans, do not use FatSecret/USDA fallbacks. Use label values or user edits only.
  - **Barcode label save must persist and confirm (Jan 2026 – locked):**
    - Save to the barcode cache when possible; if that fails, fall back to saving by barcode in the local food library so future scans still work.
    - Show a clear “Barcode saved / Barcode not saved” message with the barcode number and error text. Do not silently fail.
    - **Live database tables must exist (Jan 2026 – locked):**
      - Required tables: `BarcodeProduct` and `FoodLibraryItem`. If either is missing, barcode saves will fail and users will see “Barcode not saved.”
      - **Restore steps (if broken):**
        1) Run standard migrations against the live database.
        2) If `BarcodeProduct` is still missing due to migration history drift, run:
           - `prisma/migrations/20251223120000_add_barcode_product/migration.sql`
        3) Verify both tables exist before declaring the fix complete.
    - **Never wipe barcode data (Jan 2026 – locked):**
      - Do not delete, truncate, or reset barcode tables in live.
      - If someone asks for a wipe, stop and get explicit written approval.
    - **Rollback (if this ever causes bad data):**
      - Revert the fallback save in `app/api/barcode/label/route.ts`.
      - Revert the save confirmation banner in `app/food/page.tsx`.
- **kJ-only label handling (Jan 2026 – locked):**
  - If a label provides **kJ but no calories**, convert kJ to kcal using `kJ / 4.184` and set calories.
  - If calories are still missing, derive calories from macros: `protein*4 + carbs*4 + fat*9`.
  - Do not allow **0 calories** when any of protein/carbs/fat is non-zero.
  - **Rollback (if this ever causes bad numbers):**
    - Revert the kJ/macros-to-calories fallback in `app/api/analyze-food/route.ts` (label-scan path).
    - Revert the same fallback in `app/api/chat/fridge/route.ts` and `app/api/barcode/label/route.ts`.
    - Re-run a label scan to confirm calories revert to the label-only values.
- **Product nutrition images use the same strict block (Dec 2025 – locked):**
  - When the user selects “Product nutrition image,” apply the same label checks and block saving if numbers do not fit the serving size.
- **Serving step snapping (Nov 24, 2025 – locked):**
  - If the serving label includes a discrete count in parentheses (e.g., “10g (6 crackers)”, “1 serving (3 eggs)”), the serving step is exactly `1 / count`, and values snap to that fraction so whole numbers stay exact (no 2.002 drift).
  - For non-discrete or unspecified counts, keep the 0.25 step. Do not loosen this snapping logic without user approval.

### 4.2 Absolute Rules for Agents

Agents **must NOT**:

- Disable billing by flipping booleans such as `BILLING_ENFORCED` to `false`
  without explicit written approval from the user.
- Change how remaining credits are calculated or displayed (wallet vs. legacy
  credits) without:
  - First asking the user for permission, and
  - Gathering live JSON from:
    - `https://helfi.ai/api/credit/status`
    - `https://helfi.ai/api/credit/feature-usage`
    - `https://helfi.ai/api/credit/usage-breakdown`
- Edit the main Food Analyzer logic in `app/food/page.tsx` (analysis flow,
  ingredient cards, serving controls, nutrition totals, or diary history)
  unless the user has clearly requested a change to that specific behaviour.
- Modify `CreditManager` in `lib/credit-system.ts` to “work around” bugs
  elsewhere. Fix the real bug instead.

If credits or usage counters ever look wrong, agents must:

1. **Do not touch the Food Analyzer or credit code first.**
2. Ask the user (in simple language) to open the three credit APIs in their
   browser while logged in and paste the JSON (status, feature-usage,
   usage-breakdown).
3. Use those responses to diagnose the issue before proposing any code changes.

Only after following the above and explaining the exact plan in plain English
may an agent change any of the protected files in this section.

### 4.3 Usage Stats (Billing) – Counting Rules (Dec 2025)

Billing shows a “Your usage” section with time ranges (7 days, 1/2/6 months, all time, custom).
These counts are meant to reflect **user-visible actions**, not internal helper calls.

**Counting rules (must stay stable):**
- Food photo analysis: count **one** use per `scanId` for `food:image-analysis`, `food:text-analysis`, `food:analyze-packaged` (exclude re-analysis and ignore events without `scanId` to avoid double-logging).
- Symptom analysis: count `symptoms:analysis` events.
- Medical image analysis: count `medical-image:analysis` events.
- Light chat: count `symptoms:chat` + `medical-image:chat` events.
- Insights generation: count **one** use per `runId` for `insights:*` (excluding `insights:ask` / `insights:unknown`), plus count `insights:landing-generate` when `runId` is missing.

If you change logging or feature names, you must update these rules and re-check that displayed counts do not jump unexpectedly.

---

## 9. Mobile Food Diary “Instant Actions” (delete / duplicate / copy to today)

These mobile interactions are considered tuned and must stay instant and single-action:

- **Files:** `app/food/page.tsx` (action handlers, swipe menu, duplicate/copy logic)
- **Behaviour that must not regress:**
  - Delete (swipe + menu) removes the row immediately and only syncs in the background; no spinner or blocking wait.
  - Duplicate and “Copy to Today” add exactly **one** entry, instantly visible, with no double renders even when localDate is missing; dedupe must normalize date from timestamp.
  - Add to Favorites stays instant and non-blocking.
- **Do not:**
  - Introduce delays/spinners before the UI updates.
  - Change dedupe keys in a way that allows duplicate copies (same description/time/date) to appear.
  - Move persistence to the foreground or block the UI on API latency.
- If you need to change this flow, explain to the user why, confirm approval, and re-test: delete via swipe/menu, duplicate, and copy-to-today across different dates to ensure only one entry appears and the UI updates instantly.

---

## 6. Medical Image Analyzer & Chat (Locked)

The Medical Image Analyzer has now been stabilised and tuned end‑to‑end:

- Image upload, credit handling and analysis call  
- Structured “Analysis Results” cards (Summary, Likely conditions, Red‑flags, What to do next, Disclaimer)  
- Safety‑first handling when the AI provider refuses to analyse a high‑risk image  
- The “Chat about your medical image” follow‑up assistant with headings and bullet formatting

These flows are **considered complete** and must **not be changed** unless the user explicitly asks for a change to this area.

### 5.1 Protected Files (Medical Image Analyzer)

- `app/medical-images/page.tsx` (entire page – upload, Analyze button behaviour, Analysis Results layout, and how chat is wired in)
- `app/medical-images/MedicalImageChat.tsx` (chat UI, formatting and reset behaviour)
- `app/api/test-vision/route.ts` (medical image analysis backend, prompts, safety fallback when the provider refuses to analyse an image)
- `app/api/medical-images/chat/route.ts` (chat backend using the analysis as context)

### 5.2 Absolute Rules for Agents

Agents **must NOT**:

- Change the layout or structure of the Analysis Results cards (Summary, Likely conditions, Red‑flags, What to do next, Disclaimer) without explicit written approval from the user.  
- Change how confidence levels are displayed or ordered for conditions (high → medium → low) unless the user has specifically requested a change to that behaviour.  
- Modify the prompts or safety logic in `app/api/test-vision/route.ts` in a way that weakens the “see a real doctor” guidance when the provider refuses to analyse a potentially serious image.  
- Alter the chat formatting rules (section headings, bullets, spacing) or how the chat uses the existing analysis as context, except when the user explicitly asks for a change to the medical image chat experience.  
- Bypass or remove the guard rails that stop the model from diagnosing cancer or other life‑threatening conditions.

Agents **may**:

- Fix clear typos in user‑visible text (copy) if the meaning does not change.  
- Add strictly internal comments (for other agents) that do not alter runtime behaviour.  
- Update TypeScript types only if required by a framework upgrade, and only after confirming with the user.

Any functional change to the Medical Image Analyzer or its chat must be:

1. Explained to the user in simple, non‑technical language.  
2. Explicitly approved in writing by the user.  
3. Tested with:  
   - A “normal” image (rash/HSV/benign‑looking lesion)  
   - A clearly worrying image (suspicious mole or similar) to confirm that the safety fallback still guides the user to a real doctor.

---

## 7. Chat Formatting Across AI Conversations (Locked)

The chat UI across the app has been standardised to render ChatGPT‑style, well‑spaced messages with headings, bullets, and numbered lists even when the model streams content as one long paragraph. Do **not** loosen or remove these formatting helpers.

**Protected files:**
- `lib/chatFormatting.ts` (shared formatter that inserts line breaks around headings, bullets, and numbered lists)
- `app/symptoms/SymptomChat.tsx` (symptom analysis chat UI)
- `components/VoiceChat.tsx` (general AI chat UI)
- `app/medical-images/MedicalImageChat.tsx` (medical image follow‑up chat UI)
- `app/insights/issues/[issueSlug]/SectionChat.tsx` (insights section chats for issues like libido/medications)

Agents must not:
- Remove or bypass `formatChatContent` or equivalent line‑break/spacing logic that prevents single‑block outputs.  
- Change heading/list detection or spacing without explicit written approval from the user.  
- Make per‑feature formatting inconsistent (all chat surfaces must stay aligned on the same formatting rules).

If changes are requested, explain them to the user first, get explicit approval, and ensure all chat experiences remain consistent and readable.

---

## 9.2 Device Interest Tracking (Dashboard + Admin) — Locked

**Goal:** The “I’m interested” buttons must always record interest and show up in the admin panel counts. Do **not** break this flow.

**Protected files:**
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (Connect Your Devices buttons + labels)
- `app/api/user-data/route.ts` (persists `deviceInterest` into `__DEVICE_INTEREST__`)
- `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` (admin counts for device interest)
- `app/devices/page.tsx` and `app/health-tracking/page.tsx` (interest toggles)

**Rules (do not change without explicit user approval):**
- “I’m interested” buttons must call the interest toggle and persist to `deviceInterest` (not a no‑op UI).
- Admin counts must reflect the saved interest, including **Huawei Health**.
- **Apple Watch** and **Samsung Health** are intentionally removed from admin counts.
- Active “Interested ✓” should use the same green as “Connect” buttons (`bg-helfi-green`).
- Huawei icon is stored at `public/brands/huawei-health.png` and must stay wired in the dashboard devices grid.

If this ever breaks, restore by:
1) Verify `toggleInterest(...)` updates `deviceInterest` and POSTs to `/api/user-data`.
2) Ensure `/api/user-data/route.ts` persists `deviceInterest` to the `__DEVICE_INTEREST__` record.
3) Ensure `/api/admin/users/route.ts` counts `googleFit`, `oura`, `polar`, and `huawei` (and not `appleWatch`/`samsung`).

---

## 10. PWA Home Screen / Entry Path (Locked)
**Protected files:**
- `public/manifest.json` → `start_url` must stay `/auth/signin`, `scope` `/`, icons point to local leaf assets.
- `middleware.ts` → when a valid session exists and the path is `/auth/signin` **or `/`**, it must redirect server-side to `/pwa-entry` before rendering the login/marketing page.
- `app/pwa-entry/page.tsx` → sole server-side router that sends signed-in users to onboarding (if incomplete) or their last page/dashboard; no extra client-side redirects here.
- `app/layout.tsx` → manifest link + icons pointing at `/icons/app-192.png`, `/icons/app-512.png`, and `/apple-touch-icon.png`.
- `public/icons/app-192.png`, `public/icons/app-512.png`, `public/apple-touch-icon.png` → green leaf icons; do not swap to remote/CDN.

**Do not change any of the above without explicit user approval.** This combo is the only proven fix after multiple failed attempts.

### Required behaviour
1) When adding to Home Screen, Safari must keep `/auth/signin` (not force `/`).  
2) Opening from the icon while signed in must **skip** the login/marketing page and land in the app (onboarding if needed; otherwise last page/dashboard) via `/pwa-entry`.  
3) Home Screen icon must show the green leaf from the local assets above.

### If it breaks, restore by:
1) Set `start_url` back to `/auth/signin` in `public/manifest.json` (keep `scope: "/"`).  
2) Ensure `middleware.ts` redirects signed-in hits on `/auth/signin` or `/` to `/pwa-entry`.  
3) Keep `/pwa-entry` server-only routing; don’t add client-side effects.  
4) Keep `app/layout.tsx` manifest/icons pointing to local leaf assets; ensure the three icon files are present and correct.

### Why locked
- Changing start_url/scope or removing the middleware redirect reintroduces login flashes, wrong landing pages, or the grey URL bar.  
- Remote/CDN icons or path changes break the PWA install prompt/icon.  
- This flow was stabilised after many failed attempts; do not “experiment” here without user consent and a rollback plan.

---

## 11. Barcode Scanner (Locked)

**Protected file:** `app/food/page.tsx` (barcode scanner UI + ZXing decoder)

- The barcode scanner is now stable on iOS PWA using **ZXing** with `decodeFromConstraints`, rear camera, continuous autofocus hint, “try harder” hint, and no photo/fallback flows.
- The overlay is intentionally minimal (clear view + frame + flash + small status chip).
- Do **not** swap the decoder (no html5-qrcode, no native `BarcodeDetector`), change constraints, add photo upload, or alter the overlay without explicit written approval from the user.
- Barcode results must be saved as a single **ingredient card** item (same shape as photo/AI `analyzedItems`) using `buildBarcodeIngredientItem` → `insertBarcodeFoodIntoDiary`; keep barcode metadata (`barcode`, `barcodeSource`, `detectionMethod: 'barcode'`) and rely on ingredient cards for totals.
- Editing barcode entries must open the ingredient-card editor (triggered by `isBarcodeEntry` in `editFood`); do not strip the barcode markers or fall back to the manual text editor.
- If you must touch this area, first explain the exact change in plain language and get approval; then re-test live scanning on iOS PWA.

---

## 12. Diet Preferences, Warnings, and Macro Targets (Dec 2025 – Locked)

**Protected files:**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- `app/api/user-data/route.ts`
- `app/api/analyze-food/route.ts`
- `app/food/page.tsx`
- `lib/diets.ts`
- `lib/daily-targets.ts`

**Guard rails:**
- Diet selection is optional inside Health Setup and must not add extra numbered steps.
- Users can select multiple diets; preferences are stored via the special `__DIET_PREFERENCE__` record.
- Diet warnings must not trigger extra AI calls by default and must not cost extra credits by default.
- Diet warnings must show for meals added by analysis, favorites, and copy/duplicate.
- Diet-based macro targets must remain consistent with selected diets; when multiple diets are selected, apply the strictest carb cap and the highest protein floor.

---

## 12.1 Primary Goal Sync (Jan 2026 – Locked)

**Protected files:**
- `components/providers/UserDataProvider.tsx`
- `components/LayoutWrapper.tsx`
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- `app/food/page.tsx`
- `app/settings/food-diary/page.tsx`

**Problem this prevents:** goal choice shows differently across devices (e.g., Maintain weight on mobile, Get shredded on desktop), causing wrong daily allowance.

**Rules (do not change without owner approval):**
- The server value for `goalChoice` and `goalIntensity` is the source of truth on load.
- Cached/local values must be replaced by the server value unless the user just edited the goal on that device.
- If a mismatch is detected, the app must re-sync immediately and show a brief “Goal updated” notice.

**Required checks before claiming success:**
1) Change goal on device A.
2) Open onboarding/food diary on device B.
3) Both devices must show the same goal and allowance.

---

## 13. Pre-Launch Audit Fixes (Locked)

**Primary reference:** `AUDIT.md`

Anything marked ✅ in the audit is **locked**. Do not change, loosen, or bypass these protections unless the user explicitly approves it in writing.

### Critical fixes that must stay locked
- Direct email-only sign-in is disabled. Do not reintroduce login paths that do not require verified credentials.
- Admin access requires server-side checks. Do not reintroduce browser-only passwords or shared admin keys.
- Health files are private. Do not reintroduce public file links or direct public access.
- Debug routes must never expose AI keys or secrets. Keep these locked down or removed.
- All AI features must charge credits before returning results (or use the approved free-use counters). Do not return results before charging.

### High priority fixes that must stay locked
- Paid access is granted only when payment is confirmed. Do not keep premium access active after failed or overdue payments.
- Refunds/chargebacks must revoke credits and access. Do not leave paid credits active after a refund.
- Credit charges must be atomic. Do not allow concurrent requests to overspend credits.
- Scheduler/cron routes must require authentication (secret or signature). Do not allow public access.
- Credit receipts must be tied to the buyer. Do not allow a receipt link to be reused by another account.
- Analytics data must require authentication. Do not allow public read/write access.

---

## 14. Notifications Inbox + Reminder Opens (Locked)

**This area is fragile and business‑critical. Do not change it without the owner’s written approval.**

**Last verified working deployment:** 2026‑01‑14 12:30 UTC (commit `427f65b8`)

**Protected files:**
- `lib/notification-inbox.ts`
- `app/notifications/inbox/page.tsx`
- `app/api/notifications/inbox/route.ts`
- `app/api/notifications/pending-open/route.ts`
- `app/pwa-entry/page.tsx`
- `app/api/push/dispatch/route.ts`
- `app/api/push/scheduler/route.ts`
- `app/api/mood/dispatch/route.ts`
- `app/api/mood/push-scheduler/route.ts`

**Required behavior (must not change):**
1) Tapping a reminder must open the reminder page (check‑in or mood) even if the app was last left on another page.  
2) Reminders must always appear in the Notification inbox.  
3) Normal app opens must still go to the last page the user visited.

**If changes are requested:**
1) Explain the change in plain language first.  
2) Get explicit written approval.  
3) Re‑test reminder tap behavior and inbox logging on iPhone PWA before shipping.

### Restore steps (if this breaks again)
If reminder taps open the wrong page OR the inbox does not clear after a completed reminder, restore in this order:

0) Confirm you are testing on iPhone PWA, tapping the alert from the phone pop‑up
   (not from inside the inbox list).

1) Reminder tap routing must return a URL that includes a `notificationId`.
   - The pending‑open flow already returns `{ url, id }` and appends
     `?notificationId=<id>` when it redirects (see `app/pwa-entry/page.tsx`).
   - The tap must also set a “notification open” marker before navigation so the
     app knows a reminder was tapped (see `public/sw.js`).
   - The app must check that marker on resume and call the pending‑open API
     (see `components/LayoutWrapper.tsx`). If this step is missing, taps will
     fall back to the last page.

2) The reminder pages must capture that `notificationId` from the URL and save it
   so the save action can clear the inbox item.
   - Pages: `app/check-in/page.tsx`, `app/mood/page.tsx`, `app/mood/quick/page.tsx`
   - On load, read `window.location.search` and extract `notificationId`.
   - Save it to `sessionStorage` as `helfi:pending-notification-id`.
   - Do NOT use `useSearchParams()` here; it causes build failures. Use
     `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)` inside the client component.

3) The save endpoints must delete the inbox item using that `notificationId`.
   - `/api/checkins/today` and `/api/mood/entries` already delete by ID.
   - Do not remove that deletion, and only clear the inbox after a successful save.

4) Re‑test on iPhone PWA:
   - Tap a fresh reminder, complete it, then open inbox.
   - The alert must be gone. If not, step 2 is broken.

5) If the inbox shows the same time for every alert:
   - The list view is falling back to “now” because it cannot read the saved
     time from storage.
   - Fix by reading both `createdAt` and `createdat` (and the same for `readAt`)
     in `lib/notification-inbox.ts` so the real saved time is used.

### 14.1 Reminder limits (Free vs Paid) — Locked

**Protected files:**
- `app/notifications/reminders/page.tsx`
- `app/api/checkins/settings/route.ts`
- `app/api/mood/reminders/route.ts`
- `app/api/push/scheduler/route.ts`
- `app/api/mood/push-scheduler/route.ts`

**Required behavior (must not change):**
- Free members can set **1 reminder per day**.  
- Paid members (subscription **or** purchased credits) can set **up to 4 per day**.  
- “Free starter credits” do **not** unlock more reminders.
- The UI must show the limit and prompt users to subscribe/buy credits when they try to pick more than 1.

**Restore steps (if this breaks again):**
1) In the settings APIs, ensure `maxFrequency = isPaidUser ? 4 : 1` and clamp `frequency` to that limit.
2) In the UI, keep the warning prompt when a free user tries to pick more than 1.
3) Confirm both check‑in and mood reminders use the same limits.

Fix commit: `b93a187e` (2026-01-24)

### Medium and low priority fixes that must stay locked
- Session lifetime must not be multi-year, and admin logout/revoke must remain available.
- No fallback default secrets in production. Missing secrets must be flagged, not silently replaced.
- Rate limits must be durable (not in-memory only). Do not remove the shared limiter.
- Paid actions must not be blocked by overly strict credit estimates; keep the safe cap in place.
- Critical error alerts must continue to fire (not just console logs).
- Analytics storage must be durable (not in-memory only).
- Free-credit rules must remain consistent across all AI features.

### Profitability-related fixes that must stay locked
- AI features must never run for free unless explicitly allowed by the free-credit counters.
- Streaming responses must not complete unless charging succeeded.
- Full insights regeneration pricing must not be lowered without user approval.

If you touch any area related to these fixes, you must:
1) Explain the change in plain English to the user,  
2) Get explicit approval, and  
3) Re-test the affected flows before deployment.

## 7. Food Diary Favorites "All" Ordering (Jan 2026 - Locked)

**Goal (non-negotiable):** The most recently added entry must appear at the top
of Favorites -> All, regardless of meal date or time (including adding to past
days after midnight).

**Do not:**
- Sort by `localDate`, `time`, or meal category time.
- Rebuild the Favorites -> All list from cached/snapshot data that can override
  the latest ordering.
- Remove or ignore the "added order" stamp.

**Must keep (source of truth):**
- `app/food/page.tsx` uses an added order stamp (`__addedOrder`) for each entry.
- The list sort always prefers `__addedOrder` over any date/time fields.
- `__addedOrder` is saved on the entry and copied into `nutrition`/`total` so it
  survives merges and rehydration.
- Favorites -> All must collapse duplicate items by normalized name so each item
  appears only once (keep the most recent entry and preserve favorite links).

**If this breaks again, fix checklist (only in `app/food/page.tsx`):**
1) Ensure every entry creation path sets `addedOrder = Date.now()` and passes it
   into `ensureEntryLoggedAt(...)`.
2) Confirm `mapLogsToEntries(...)` reads `nutrients.__addedOrder` (if present)
   and assigns `entry.__addedOrder`.
3) Confirm `resolveEntryCreatedAtMs(...)` uses `__addedOrder` first.
4) Confirm `ensureEntryLoggedAt(...)` writes `__addedOrder` onto the entry and
   into `nutrition`/`total`.
5) Ensure Favorites -> All collapses duplicates by normalized label:
   - Keep `dedupeAllMealsByLabel(...)` in `buildFavoritesDatasets`.
   - It must merge items with the same normalized label and keep the newest one.
   - It must preserve any favorite link (so edit/delete still works).
6) If duplicates reappear:
   - Restore the `dedupeAllMealsByLabel(...)` block (and helpers) near
     `buildFavoritesDatasets` in `app/food/page.tsx`.
   - Make sure `allMealsRaw` flows through that dedupe before `allMealsWithFavorites`.
   - Do not remove the `usedFavoriteIds` / `usedLabels` tracking that runs
     after the dedupe (keeps Favorites from re-adding duplicates).

## 7.1 Credits Bar Reload Jitter (Jan 2026 - Locked)

**Goal (non-negotiable):** The Credits Remaining bar must **not** reload and
shift food flows when you leave and return (Food Diary, Food Analysis, Build Meal,
Add Ingredient). It should appear instantly and update quietly in the background.

**Do not:**
- Clear the saved credits display on every return to the page.
- Render the meter only after a fresh network call.

**Must keep (source of truth):**
- The credits bar reads a stored value first (same session) and shows it
  immediately across food flows (even if the component remounts).
- The network call runs after, then updates the bar without a layout jump.

**If this breaks again, fix checklist:**
1) Restore the "show stored value first" behavior for the credits bar.
2) Keep the background refresh, but do **not** block initial render on it.
3) Ensure the cached value is reused on food sub-pages (analysis, build meal,
   add ingredient) rather than only the main diary view.

## 7.2 Exercise Modal Draft Persistence (Jan 2026 - Locked)

**Goal (non-negotiable):** The "Add exercise" modal must keep the user's
in-progress inputs when they close and reopen it (manual entry flow), instead of
resetting to defaults every time.

**Do not:**
- Reset the draft state on every modal open for new manual entries.
- Clear user-entered values unless the user explicitly changes them or saves.

**Must keep (source of truth):**
- Draft state persists for the manual exercise modal between open/close.
- Editing an existing exercise entry still loads the entry values (not the draft).

**If this breaks again, fix checklist:**
1) Restore draft persistence for manual exercise entries.
2) Keep edit-mode hydration (existing entry data overrides the draft).

## 7.3 Support Chat & Tickets (Jan 2026 - Locked)

This support system has been reworked and must not be changed without explicit
owner approval.

**Protected files:**
- `app/support/page.tsx`
- `components/support/SupportChatWidget.tsx`
- `app/api/support/tickets/route.ts`
- `app/api/support/inquiry/route.ts`
- `lib/support-automation.ts`

- `scripts/build-support-code-index.js`

**Must keep (source of truth):**
- Support page has two states for logged‑in users:
  - Ticket entry + Past tickets list.
  - Live chat view.
- Back button behavior:
  - If in chat view → returns to ticket entry.
  - If in ticket entry → returns to the page the user came from (not always dashboard).
- Submitting the support form does **not** auto‑open chat.
  - After submit, show a choice: “Start chat now” or “Just email me.”
- Past tickets list (logged‑in) with **View** and **Delete**.
  - Delete must permanently remove the ticket and its responses.
- Homepage support widget is **guest‑only** (not visible for logged‑in users).
  - Guest tickets stored in `localStorage` history with **View/Delete**.
- Chat UI:
  - Only the message list scrolls.
  - Input field stays visible.
  - Mobile chat view is full‑width with no horizontal overflow.
- Support AI:
  - Model locked to **gpt‑5.2**.
  - No fallback models.
  - Answers must be based on Support KB + product facts + code context only.
  - If not verified, the bot must escalate and tell the user they will receive an email.
- Support code index is rebuilt on deploy via `prebuild`.
  - Do not remove or bypass `scripts/build-support-code-index.js`.

## 7.4 Admin Login + Authenticator (Locked)

**Goal:** Prevent admin lockouts caused by password or authenticator changes.

**Protected files:**
- `app/admin-panel/page.tsx`
- `app/admin-panel/qr-login/page.tsx`
- `app/api/admin/auth/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin/qr-login/start/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin/qr-login/status/route.ts`
- `app/api/admin/qr-login/approve/route.ts`
- `lib/admin-auth.ts`

**Rules (do not change without explicit owner approval):**
- Do not change the admin login flow, password checks, or authenticator logic.
- Do not reset admin passwords or authenticator secrets in the database.
- Do not change the admin email in the database.

**If login breaks:**
1. Get the owner’s written approval before any password or authenticator reset.
2. If a reset is approved, tell the owner they must scan a new QR code.
3. After any change, test both:
   - Email + authenticator login on desktop.
   - QR login approval on phone.

**Last stable deployment:** `dbe9205a` (2026-01-24)

## 8. Rules for Future Modifications

Before changing anything in the protected areas above, an agent **must**:

1. Read this `GUARD_RAILS.md` file in full.  
2. Summarise to the user (in simple, non‑technical language) exactly what they intend to change.  
3. Ask for and receive explicit written approval from the user.  
4. After making changes, re‑test:
   - New user (first sign‑up, no data)  
   - Partially completed Health Setup  
   - Fully completed Health Setup  
   - “I’ll do it later” behaviour  
   - 5‑minute reminder (“Complete Health Setup” and “Don’t ask me again”)  
   - Insights gating (locked vs unlocked)

If there is *any* doubt, the agent should **not** touch these flows and must ask the user
for guidance first.

# CODEX NOTES

## FRANK HANDOVER — 2025-11-01 (Live still not meeting requirements)

This is a blunt status for the next agent. The live site is still failing core requirements. Below is exactly what the user expects, what is broken, why it is broken (with file-level references), what changed today, and what must be done next.

### User’s non‑negotiable requirements (verbatim intent)
- AI results must be ready immediately after Health Intake completion ("Confirm & Begin"). No waiting a minute after opening a section.
- Insights must reflect ONLY the issues the user selected during intake; no legacy/stale items (e.g., “Brain Fog”) appearing.
- Each relevant section must ALWAYS show at least 4 Suggested and 4 To‑Avoid items.
- “What’s Working” must reflect the user’s logged items (e.g., supplements, exercise) right away, with clear reasons tied to the issue.
- Content must be AI‑generated (not static filler), but reliability is non‑negotiable: the system must guarantee the minimum counts even when the model under‑delivers.
- Performance: warm ≤1s; cold ≤7s; initial post‑intake open must not feel cold.

### Live symptoms observed right now (2025‑11‑01)
- Libido → Supplements shows empty/weak output:
  - “What’s Working” empty despite a long supplement list.
  - “Supplements to Avoid” shows only 1 item (e.g., St John’s Wort) instead of ≥4.
- Sections can still take 30–60s on first open when cache is cold.
- Previously selected issues sometimes replaced by legacy goals (historical rows) for some accounts; improvements were made today but require verification under load.

### Why this is still happening (root causes with file‑level pointers)
1) Supplements/Medications 4/4 top‑ups are effectively disabled.
   - In `lib/insights/issue-engine.ts` the supplements and medications builders call `ensureMin(...)` with fallbacks (`kbAddLocal`, `kbAvoidLocal`) that are never populated anymore.
   - Result: output relies solely on live LLM and returns <4 items routinely; “What’s Working” does not map from logs when LLM omits it.

2) Heavy LLM on cold path + fragile caching.
   - `computeIssueSection(...)` still calls the full context + LLM when cache miss; degraded caching is inconsistent and not always served first.
   - No time‑cap to return a stored result within ~1s; user sees long spinners.

3) Issue source of truth drifted for some users.
   - Landing/sections historically fell back to legacy `healthGoals` when `CheckinIssues` was empty. Today we moved toward treating `__SELECTED_ISSUES__` as authoritative, but production still needs verification and data backfill.

4) Observability is insufficient.
   - Timings/flags are not consistently exposed in `extras` or analytics, making it hard to prove cache hits vs cold builds on live.

### What changed TODAY (deployed)
- `app/api/user-data/route.ts`:
  - Guarded `__SELECTED_ISSUES__` so we only update it when a real goals array is posted.
  - Added precise logging for GET/POST, including parsed snapshot and payload characteristics.
- `lib/insights/issue-engine.ts`:
  - Landing loader now prefers `__SELECTED_ISSUES__` ahead of legacy goals when `CheckinIssues` is empty.
  - Nutrition and Lifestyle now deterministically top‑up to guarantee 4/4 after domain filtering using `ISSUE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE` (live). Build error from KB indexing was fixed (null‑safe access added).
  - NOTE: Supplements/Medications still need KB‑driven top‑ups re‑enabled (see Next Steps). Their fallback arrays are currently empty → 4/4 is not guaranteed.
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`:
  - On Step 4 we snapshot selected issues to `/api/user-data` so Insights aligns with intake even when check‑ins are disabled.

### Evidence (live)
- Screenshots show Libido → Supplements with only 1 avoid item and no working mapping despite many logged supplements.
- First‑open latency still spikes on cold paths.

### Do NOT repeat
- Don’t add more background layers on a broken cache. Fix cache writes/reads first and prove they work with analytics.
- Don’t block first paint on LLM. If you cannot guarantee a warm cache after intake, you must serve a stored/degraded result within ~1s, then upgrade in background.
- Don’t return <4/4 in any section. If the model under‑delivers, run a guaranteed fill stage (AI or KB‑assisted) before responding.
- Don’t fall back to legacy `healthGoals` once `__SELECTED_ISSUES__` exists for the user.

### Immediate next steps (actionable)
1) Fix Supplements/Medications 4/4 deterministically (today/tomorrow):
   - In `buildSupplementsSection` and `buildMedicationsSection`, repopulate `kbAddLocal`/`kbAvoidLocal` from `ISSUE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE[pickKnowledgeKey(issue.name)]` and keep the existing `ensureMin(...)` calls. Also map logged supplements/medications to “What’s Working” when the LLM omits them.
   - Acceptance: Libido and Bowel Movements show ≥4 Suggested and ≥4 Avoid in Supplements and Medications within one page refresh.

2) Make post‑intake insights actually ready:
   - On `POST /api/user-data` after “Confirm & Begin”, synchronously kick a bounded precompute for all selected issues/sections and do not redirect until cache writes succeed (or a short timeout writes a degraded result). Limit concurrency and instrument timings.

3) Enforce a strict 1s first‑byte policy on read:
   - On section GET, if no validated cache in ~1s, return stored degraded (short TTL) immediately and upgrade in background; never leave users waiting.

4) Observability you can read in production:
   - Put `{ cacheHit, degradedUsed, firstByteMs, computeMs }` and per‑phase LLM timings into `extras`, and emit to `/api/analytics?action=insights`.

5) Cut through stale caches:
   - Bump `pipelineVersion` once 4/4 is re‑enabled everywhere so old “latest” rows are ignored.

### Acceptance criteria (restate)
- After intake completion (“Confirm & Begin”), opening any issue → section returns data within ≤1s (warm) or ≤7s (cold) and shows ≥4 Suggested and ≥4 Avoid, with “What’s Working” reflecting logged items when present. Issue list matches intake selection exactly.

---

## SESSION LOG — 2025-11-01 (Issue selection still misaligned)
- **User-reported symptom:** Insights landing lists “Brain Fog” (and occasionally other legacy issues) even after the health intake is reconfirmed with only Libido, Erection Quality, Energy, and Bowel Movements selected. Re-running all 11 steps does not remove the extra issue.
- **Recent changes (now live):**
  - Commit `c2d4609`: stripped all deterministic KB fallbacks so sections only display genuine LLM output (no forced ≥4 Suggested/Avoid). This exposed the underlying data problem because guidance now stays empty until the correct issue list is resolved.
  - Commit `3fe2e03`: reintroduced a temporary fallback to historic `healthGoals` so Insights didn’t render blank when `CheckinIssues` is empty (check-ins feature flag is off in production).
  - Commit `8418561`: attempted to snapshot the intake selection by writing `__SELECTED_ISSUES__` via `/api/user-data` and prioritising that list inside `loadUserInsightContext`/`loadUserLandingContext`.
- **What still goes wrong:** On production, the snapshot either never updates or is immediately overwritten by legacy data. `CheckinIssues` returns zero rows, so the fallback path keeps pulling from older `healthGoals` records that still include “Brain Fog.” Repeating the intake flow does not change what Insights shows.
- **Do not repeat:** merely shuffling fallback order or deleting KB entries will not fix the core issue. The real fix requires confirming which service writes the authoritative issue list, instrumenting `/api/user-data` (and any other writers) to ensure the selected set is saved, and migrating legacy health goal rows that should no longer surface.
- **Next actions recommended:** log the exact payloads hitting `/api/user-data`, identify every code path that mutates `HealthGoal` rows, and either (a) turn on `CheckinIssues` for production users and migrate the data, or (b) ensure the snapshot row cannot be overwritten by historical records.

## LIVE USER FEEDBACK — 2025-10-24
1) Supplements → What’s Working shows “You’re not taking any supplements…” for Libido despite user logging multiple libido-supportive supplements.
   - Likely cause: the new “starter” path sets `extras.supportiveDetails = []` for supplements, so the Working tab renders empty until the full AI upgrade arrives. This is misleading and looks like “no data”.
   - Required fix: in `buildStarterSectionWithContext` for `supplements`, map logged supplements that match `ISSUE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE[issue].helpfulSupplements` into `supportiveDetails` with dose/timing. Guarantee at least 1–4 items when logs exist.

2) Bowel Movements → Supplements: “Suggested Supplements” and “Supplements to Avoid” often show nothing.
   - Likely causes:
     - No KB entry for this issue (or weak KB), so starter top-ups return empty.
     - Full AI upgrade is slow or failing, leaving only the empty starter.
   - Required fix: add a robust KB block for “bowel movements” (aliases: constipation, irregular stools, etc.) with ≥4 `helpfulSupplements` (with suggested protocols) and ≥4 `avoidSupplements`, plus nutrition/lifestyle items. Ensure starter top-ups use KB to hit 4/4.

3) Counts not met: Some sections still render <4 Suggested and <4 Avoid (e.g., Nutrition only 2/2).
   - Current code added `ensureMin(...)` for nutrition starter, but similar enforcement is missing/weak in other sections or relies on KB that is too sparse.
   - Required fix: apply consistent 4/4 enforcement for all sections (starter and full), and expand KB where sparse (Libido, Bowel Movements, etc.).

4) Perceived latency improved but UX is still poor when starters are blank/misleading.
   - When starters don’t include “What’s Working,” users see empty states even though they have data. The “Initial guidance…” banner is not enough to offset this.
   - Required fix: starters must always be useful: show mapped “What’s Working” from logs and guaranteed 4/4 Suggested/Avoid from KB immediately; then upgrade quietly.

5) Daily/Weekly/Custom: gating works, but users expect richer copy and clear notice when no new data vs. queued refresh.
   - Consider small toast/badge indicating “No new data to generate” vs “Refreshing in background”.

Actionable next steps (do not deploy until verified on preview):
1) Supplements starter: populate `supportiveDetails` from logs + KB matches; ensure min 1–4 when logs exist.
2) Add strong KB for “Bowel Movements”: ≥4 helpful, ≥4 avoid (with protocols/why); also add nutrition and lifestyle focus lists.
3) Enforce 4/4 everywhere at starter and full outputs; if LLM under-delivers, top up from KB deterministically.
4) Improve copy for “no new data” and “upgrading…”; keep current report visible.
5) Verify on preview: Libido and Bowel Movements should render instantly with 4/4 and non-empty Working based on the user’s logs.

## Current Status (2025-10-10)
- **Outcome:** Latest deployment still fails key requirements. Keep this as a known-bad-but-instrumented baseline; do not repeat the same approach without implementing remediation below.
- **User feedback highlights:**
  1. Nutrition “Suggested Foods” and “Foods to Avoid” now surface supplements/alcohol (e.g. Tongkat Ali, Saw Palmetto) instead of food-only guidance.
  2. Supplements → “To Avoid” routinely returns zero AI-generated items.
  3. Insights still take ~20s+ to load after tapping a section despite new prefetch logic.
  4. Exercise guidance incorrectly recommends supplements.
  5. Pre-generation promised after health intake completion is not delivering; users still wait on first visit.

## What This Agent Attempted (and Why It Failed)
1. **LLM Wrapper Rewrite (`lib/insights/llm.ts`)**
   - Enforced stricter JSON schema, variable minimum counts, and an automatic “repair” pass that re-prompts the model.
   - Reduced `max_tokens` to 650, `temperature` 0.05, and forced every section to output ≥4 suggested / ≥2 avoid items.
   - **Failure:** The prompt changes still allow non-food items into nutrition arrays, the repair pass does not guarantee domain-correct buckets, and avoid/suggested lists can still come back empty. The stricter schema does **not** fix quality.

2. **Section Builders Overhaul (`lib/insights/issue-engine.ts`)**
   - Removed previous gating states (e.g., “log meals first”), always called the LLM, dynamically set `minWorking = 0` when no logs, and added client-facing highlights about missing data.
   - Added new metadata to `extras` (e.g., `hasLogged`, `hasRecentUpdates`) to inform UI copy.
   - **Failure:** Logic intended to keep buckets domain-specific is insufficient; nutrition/exercise prompts still leak supplements, and avoid lists are empty because the model ignores instructions. UX regressions remain.

3. **Prefetch + Precompute**
   - New API `POST /api/insights/issues/[slug]/sections/prefetch` and helper `precomputeIssueSectionsForUser` now run with concurrency 3 (was 2). UI `SectionPrefetcher` triggers batch prefetch on mount.
   - After onboarding save (`POST /api/user-data`), precompute is triggered server-side.
   - **Failure (live):** Users still observe 30s+ waits on first open. Cache is not always warm; strict cache policy may skip writes on validation failure, causing repeated cold paths.

4. **Caching Adjustments**
   - v2 only caches validated results with `pipelineVersion: "v2"` and `validated=true`.
   - **Live gap:** When validation fails, nothing is cached → repeated cold runs → user-visible delays. We need a short-TTL degraded cache path and background upgrader.

## Guidance for Next Agent
1. **Do not rely solely on prompt + repair.** Enforce boundaries with a classifier and a rewrite-to-domain step.
2. **Revisit domain-specific prompting per section.** Keep AI-only, but add rewrite-to-domain before final filtering.
3. **Make precompute actually hide cold latency.** Trigger on intake save and Insights landing; increase concurrency after measuring; serve degraded cache immediately when validated cache is missing.
4. **Respect data separation:**
   - Nutrition: foods only; never alcohol or supplements.
   - Exercise: movement entries only.
   - Supplements/Medications: use logged items for “working”, but still generate ≥4 suggested and ≥4 avoid items even with empty logs.
5. **User non-negotiables (must remain true regardless of implementation path):**
   - Entirely AI-generated content—no hard-coded filler.
   - Minimum counts: Suggested ≥4, Avoid ≥4 (user increased requirement); Working reflects logged items only.
   - Provide detailed mechanisms + practical guidance (dose/timing or execution).
   - Performance: sections must render ≤4 s (warm) / ≤7 s (cold), with insights ready instantly after intake completion or a degraded result shown immediately and upgraded in background.

## Next Steps (Recommended)
1. Add rewrite-to-domain pass and degraded-but-valid fallback (never return null; always 4/4). Keep AI-only content.
2. Instrument timings in `extras`: generateMs, classifyMs, rewriteMs, fillMs, totalMs; log cacheHit/cacheMiss.
3. Adjust caching: short-TTL (≈2min) for `validated=false` results; background upgrader to re-run rewrite/fill to validated.
4. Trigger precompute on Insights landing (not only intake save) with concurrency 4 after measuring.
5. Only redeploy after verifying locally and on a preview that:
   - Nutrition shows foods only.
   - Supplements/Exercise avoid lists contain ≥4 relevant items even with empty logs.
   - Cold path renders immediately (degraded or cached), and background upgrade occurs within 7s.
   - Average response time meets targets.

## INCIDENT LOG — v3 Attempt (2025-10-11) commit d04c946

This section documents exactly what the last agent changed and why it regressed live performance/UX, so the next agent does not repeat these steps.

### Exact Code Changes
- `lib/insights/llm.ts`
  - Added rewrite-to-domain helper and integrated it before fill-missing.
  - Increased fill-missing attempts (2→3) with diversity prompts.
  - Implemented `generateDegradedSection` (synthesized 4/4); timings stored in a private `_timings` field.

- `lib/insights/issue-engine.ts`
  - Calls degraded generator only if the main LLM returns null (not on slow or low-count responses).
  - Sets `extras.degraded = !validated` and allows caching degraded with short TTL (~2 min).
  - Precompute default concurrency raised to 4; cache read logic honors degraded TTL vs validated TTL.

- `app/api/insights/issues/[slug]/sections/prefetch/route.ts`
  - `concurrency` default 4; added `forceAllIssues` support (unused by UI).

- `app/insights/issues/[issueSlug]/SectionPrefetcher.tsx`
  - Sends `concurrency=4`; does not render degraded immediately on cache miss.

- `app/api/analytics/route.ts`
  - `GET?action=insights` returns recent timing entries, but no emitters were added so the endpoint is effectively empty.

### Live Regression (User Report)
- Supplements section took ~55 seconds to open on production (goal: ≤7s); UI showed “Initial guidance generated…” but lists were empty instead of guaranteed 4/4.

### Likely Root Causes
1) Too many sequential LLM calls: generate → classify → rewrite per bucket → re-classify → fill (up to 3) → re-classify.
2) Degraded fallback not time-based: only triggers on hard LLM failure, not on slow responses or low counts.
3) Client does not render degraded instantly on cache miss; still blocks user while server computes.
4) Timings not exposed in `extras`, reducing observability.

### Do Not Repeat — Alternative Approach
1) Enforce a strict time cap: if no validated cache by ~1s, immediately render a prebuilt degraded 4/4 and start a background upgrade.
2) Collapse rewrite/classify steps or apply rewrite selectively to only the deltas that fail domain checks.
3) Put timings inside `extras` and emit analytics so `GET?action=insights` has real data.
4) Keep degraded data session-local unless necessary to persist; if persisted, TTL ≤ 2 min and ensure background upgrade job is fired.

### Rollback Guidance
- Revert commit `d04c946bf2486789ff0a4e9104fa8d3020c2af0a` to return to the instrumented v2 baseline.
  - `git revert d04c946bf2486789ff0a4e9104fa8d3020c2af0a` and push to master (this repo auto-deploys to Vercel).

### Commit Reference
- v3 attempt: `d04c946bf2486789ff0a4e9104fa8d3020c2af0a`
  - Key side-effects: slower cold path, no immediate degraded render, timing data not visible in `extras`.

## SESSION LOG — 2025-10-16 (Agent attempt REVERTED)

Outcome
- The deployment made in commit `0268398` ("Insights: fast-path + degraded fallback; guaranteed >=4 Suggested/Avoid; chat UX with history; fix Nutrition/Supplements cold load") was rolled back by `git revert`.
- Reason: User observed sections stalling (skeleton loading) and no improvement in perceived cold time (still ~20–25s). Requested immediate revert to the previous working deployment.

What this agent changed (now reverted)
1) New fast-path generator in `lib/insights/llm.ts` (`generateSectionInsightsFast`), using one-shot candidate generation with `candidateType` hints plus single top-ups. Attached `_timings`.
2) Switched section builders (supplements, medications, exercise, nutrition) in `lib/insights/issue-engine.ts` to call the fast path; copied timings into `extras` for UI.
3) Added quick/degraded paths: `buildSupplementsSectionDegraded()` and later `buildNutritionSectionDegraded()`; `computeIssueSection` raced full vs quick.
4) “Working” lists built from logs via `ISSUE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE` so obvious helpers appear without LLM.
5) Chat changed from one-shot to simple threaded: `app/insights/.../SectionChat.tsx` and `app/api/insights/ask/route.ts` now accept message history and section context; local storage keeps per-issue history.

Observed problems
- Cold loads still ~20–25s for some users; one report showed Nutrition stuck on skeletons.
- Supplements “Working” sometimes empty in the quick result despite logged items.
- Quality still inconsistent across sections (≥4 Suggested/Avoid not always visible at first paint).

Suspected causes (do NOT repeat without addressing)
1) Heavy DB/context load (`loadUserInsightContext`) still runs before quick path; that alone can push first-byte over the target.
2) The quick path wasn’t used everywhere at first; for some routes the full path still blocked first paint.
3) Added complexity increased risk of extras shape mismatch between quick/full results.

Rollback
- Reverted commit: `0268398` with `git revert 0268398` and pushed to `master` (auto-deployed by Vercel).
- Baseline now matches commit `b5e31a9` (pre-attempt state).

Guidance for next agent (avoid repeating)
1) Do not add more LLM passes. Focus on time-capping and cache-first.
2) First-byte must not depend on the heavy context loader. Consider a minimal-context endpoint (just user ID + issue slug) to serve a tiny, prebuilt “starter” insight from KV, then upgrade.
3) Surface server timings in `extras`: { dbMs, computeMs, cacheHit, cold }. Add logging you can read in Logs tab.
4) Enforce ≥4/4 at the data layer with deterministic fallbacks rather than retrying the model.

## SESSION LOG — 2025-10-17 (Degraded-first quick path attempt)

Outcome
- Deployed a degraded-first path intended to show guidance immediately and upgrade in the background. Result: user still observed 30–40s waits after tapping sections/tabs; no improvement in perceived first-paint time.

Exact Code Changes
- `lib/insights/llm.ts`
  - Added `generateDegradedSectionQuick(input, options)`: single LLM call via `generateSectionCandidates`, domain-filtered, returns ≥4/4 suggested/avoid without repair loops.

- `lib/insights/issue-engine.ts`
  - Commit `10ee692`: Introduced Nutrition-only quick path with 1s race; returned degraded on slow full build; background upgrade writes cache.
  - Commit `0cd1336`: Fixed missing `mode`/`range` on quick result to satisfy `IssueSectionResult` type.
  - Commit `0d468e4`: Expanded quick path to all sections (except `overview`/`interactions`), removed the 1s timeout, always returned degraded-first, mapped degraded output into section-specific `extras`, wrote degraded to cache (short TTL), and kicked off full compute in background.

- `app/api/insights/issues/[slug]/sections/prefetch/route.ts`
  - Switched from heavy `precomputeIssueSectionsForUser` to a “quick warm” that calls `generateDegradedSectionQuick` for each section; added simple concurrency. Commit `7e8d681` fixed TypeScript generics and removed unused imports.

Observed Problems (Live)
- Users still saw 30–40s before any content appeared on section/tab open.
- Prefetch did not noticeably reduce cold waits.

Root Causes (Do not repeat)
1) Quick path still blocked on an LLM call.
   - `generateDegradedSectionQuick` invokes OpenAI once per section. When that call is slow in production, first paint still blocks. Degraded-first must not call the LLM before responding.

2) Prefetch didn’t persist usable results for the read path.
   - The quick prefetch intentionally avoided DB writes; the subsequent read still triggered the same LLM call, so prefetch often doubled load instead of warming reads.

3) Concurrency amplification.
   - Landing prefetch fanned out multiple quick calls at once, increasing tail latency and contention.

4) No instant, stored fallback.
   - There was no static or cached degraded payload returned in <1s; everything depended on live LLM latency.

What to try next
1) Serve from storage first: no LLM on first byte.
   - Return stored degraded (KV/DB) immediately. If none exists, return a pre-generated generic degraded result per issue/section (AI-generated ahead of time). Mark `degraded=true`; start background upgrade.

2) Write-through caching.
   - Persist both degraded and validated outputs with TTLs. Prefetch must upsert degraded so GET can read from cache only.

3) Strict time cap and controlled fan-out.
   - Cap first response to ~1s; limit prefetch concurrency (e.g., ≤2) and defer the rest.

4) Observability.
   - Add `extras`: { cacheHit, degradedUsed, firstByteMs, computeMs, backgroundUpgradeMs } and emit lightweight analytics entries to confirm SLAs in production.

Rollback Guidance
- To return to the prior baseline, revert: `0d468e4 10ee692 0cd1336 7e8d681`.

Commit References
- `10ee692` — Nutrition quick path (1s race) + background upgrade.
- `0cd1336` — Quick result type fix (`mode`, `range`).
- `0d468e4` — Degraded-first for all sections, no timeout, extras mapping, prefetch warm.
- `7e8d681` — Prefetch TypeScript fix and cleanup.

Note
- The attempted fix failed because first paint still waited for a live LLM call. To truly reduce cold latency, serve cached or pre-generated degraded data immediately, then upgrade asynchronously.

## SESSION LOG — 2025-10-17 (Event-Driven Background Regeneration - FAILED)

Outcome
- Deployed commit `1d413b1` with "event-driven background regeneration system". Result: **COMPLETE FAILURE**. User tested on live site: clicked "Confirm & Begin" on health intake, waited, navigated to Insights → Libido → Supplements. Still took **55 seconds to load**. Zero improvement.

What this agent changed
- Created entirely new file `lib/insights/regeneration-service.ts` with:
  - `InsightsMetadata` table to track when insights were last generated and data fingerprints
  - `triggerBackgroundRegeneration()` function that fires on data changes (supplements, meds, food, etc.)
  - `checkInsightsStatus()` to detect if insights are stale
  - Smart change detection using data fingerprints to determine which sections need regen
  - User-friendly status messages ("Fresh insights", "No changes detected", etc.)

- Modified `app/api/user-data/route.ts`:
  - Replaced existing `precomputeIssueSectionsForUser` call with event-driven triggers
  - Detects which data types changed (supplements, medications, goals, profile, etc.)
  - Calls `triggerBackgroundRegeneration()` for each change type (non-blocking)

- Modified `app/api/food-log/route.ts`:
  - Added `triggerBackgroundRegeneration()` call after food log creation
  - Triggers nutrition insights regeneration in background

- Modified `app/api/insights/issues/[slug]/sections/[section]/route.ts`:
  - Added `checkInsightsStatus()` call to GET endpoint
  - Returns enriched response with `_meta` containing status, lastGenerated, statusMessage, etc.

- Modified `lib/insights/issue-engine.ts`:
  - Added `sectionsFilter` parameter to `PrecomputeOptions` type
  - Logic to filter target sections based on `sectionsFilter` for selective regeneration

The Agent's Theory (Why It Should Have Worked)
- Agent claimed this was "fundamentally different" from previous agents
- Theory: Generate insights in background when data changes → user sees instant cached results
- Mapping: supplements change → only regenerate supplements section (not everything)
- Expected timeline: 3-4 minutes background processing after intake completion
- Expected UX: Click section → instant display (<2s) of cached insights with status message

Why It Actually Failed (Confirmed on Live Site)
1) **Background generation never actually ran or completed successfully**
   - User waited "a while" after confirming intake
   - First section (Libido overview) loaded fine
   - Supplements section still took 55 seconds
   - This means cache was NOT populated, so it fell back to generating on-demand
   - The background job either didn't fire, didn't complete, or didn't write results to cache

2) **Critical flaw: Background jobs depend on existing cache infrastructure**
   - The regeneration service calls `precomputeIssueSectionsForUser()` in background
   - But if the existing cache infrastructure is broken (which it clearly is), background jobs fail too
   - Agent didn't fix the underlying cache write/read problems
   - Just added another layer on top of a broken foundation

3) **No verification that background jobs actually work**
   - Agent didn't test that background jobs fire correctly
   - Didn't verify that `triggerBackgroundRegeneration()` actually completes
   - Didn't check server logs to see if background processing succeeded
   - Assumed everything would "just work" without testing

4) **The core problem remains unsolved: LLM calls are still slow**
   - When cache is empty or background job fails, system still calls LLM on-demand
   - That LLM call still takes 55 seconds
   - Nothing in this implementation made LLM calls faster
   - Just tried to hide the problem with background jobs that don't work

5) **Event triggers may not be reliable**
   - `triggerBackgroundRegeneration()` wraps call in `setImmediate()` and `.catch()`
   - If it fails silently, no insights are generated
   - No error logging visible to user or subsequent agents
   - No retry mechanism if background job fails

What Actually Happened (User's Experience)
1. User completed health intake
2. Clicked "Confirm & Begin"
3. Waited some time (letting background jobs supposedly run)
4. Navigated to Insights → Libido
5. Overview loaded okay
6. Clicked "Supplements"
7. **WAITED 55 SECONDS** (exact same problem as before)
8. System clearly generated insights on-demand, not from cache

Root Cause Analysis
- Agent added complexity (new service, new table, background triggers) without fixing the fundamental issue
- The existing cache read/write system is broken
- Background jobs depend on that broken cache system
- Therefore background jobs also fail
- Result: No improvement whatsoever

Critical Mistakes This Agent Made
1. **Didn't test the solution before deploying** - Just assumed background jobs would work
2. **Added complexity instead of fixing root cause** - Built new layer on broken foundation
3. **No verification or logging** - Can't even tell if background jobs ran
4. **Ignored that previous agents tried similar approaches** - Background precompute was already attempted
5. **Made confident claims without evidence** - Said it would work in 3-4 minutes, provided no proof

What NOT to Do Next
- Do NOT add more background job infrastructure
- Do NOT assume caching will "just work"
- Do NOT add event triggers without testing them
- Do NOT deploy without verifying on live site
- Do NOT trust that `precomputeIssueSectionsForUser()` works (it clearly doesn't)

What the REAL Problem Is (Still Unsolved)
1. Cache writes are failing or not persisting correctly
2. Cache reads are not returning stored results
3. LLM calls take 55 seconds and there's no way around that
4. The ONLY solution is: serve pre-generated content immediately (not LLM on-demand)
5. Need to verify cache table exists, writes succeed, reads return data, TTLs are reasonable

Rollback Guidance
- Revert commit `1d413b1fafe9b2c8bd13fb8ed052b3ee4137cf7f`
- `git revert 1d413b1` and push to master (auto-deploys to Vercel)
- This will remove the entire regeneration-service and restore previous (equally broken) state

- Message: "Event-driven insights: Background regeneration system"
- Result: **ZERO IMPROVEMENT - COMPLETE FAILURE**

What Next Agent MUST Do Differently
1. **Test the cache infrastructure FIRST** - Verify InsightsSectionCache table exists and works
2. **Add logging to see what's actually happening** - Can't fix what you can't see
3. **Start simple** - Fix cache reads/writes before adding background jobs
4. **Verify on live site BEFORE claiming success** - This agent never did that
5. **Accept that LLM calls are slow** - Must serve cached/pre-generated content, not optimize LLM speed

The Harsh Truth
- Every agent so far has tried variations of the same thing: generate faster, cache better, background jobs
- NONE of it works because the cache infrastructure is fundamentally broken
- Until someone actually fixes the cache read/write layer, nothing will improve
- Stop building elaborate systems on top of a broken foundation
- Fix the foundation first: make sure ONE insight can be generated, cached, and retrieved successfully
- Then scale from there

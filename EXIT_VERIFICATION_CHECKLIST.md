# ‚úÖ MANDATORY EXIT VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

## üö® **BEFORE YOU CAN FINISH - PROVE EVERYTHING**

**NO AGENT CAN CLAIM TO BE DONE WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS CHECKLIST**

---

## üìã **STEP 1: TEST EVERY CLAIM ON LIVE SITE**

### **FOR EACH THING YOU CLAIM TO HAVE FIXED:**

#### **Food Analyzer Fix Verification:**
- [ ] I uploaded a food photo at https://helfi.ai/food
- [ ] I received detailed AI analysis (not fallback text like "This appears to be food...")
- [ ] I took a screenshot of the working analysis
- [ ] I confirmed no 401 errors in browser console
- **Proof Required**: Screenshot of working food analysis

#### **Authentication Fix Verification:**
- [ ] I logged out completely
- [ ] I logged in at https://helfi.ai/auth/signin with valid credentials
- [ ] I was redirected to dashboard successfully
- [ ] I can access protected pages
- **Proof Required**: Screenshot of successful login flow

#### **UI Fix Verification:**
- [ ] I viewed the changed UI elements on https://helfi.ai (not localhost)
- [ ] I confirmed the styling changes are live
- [ ] I tested on both desktop and mobile if relevant
- [ ] I verified no layout breaks occurred
- **Proof Required**: Before/after screenshots

#### **API Fix Verification:**
- [ ] I tested the API endpoint on live site
- [ ] I confirmed no error responses
- [ ] I verified expected data is returned
- [ ] I checked browser network tab for errors
- **Proof Required**: Screenshot of successful API response

---

## üìã **STEP 2: UPDATE ALL TRACKING FILES**

### **CURRENT_ISSUES_LIVE.md:**
- [ ] I updated the status of each issue I worked on
- [ ] I marked fixed issues as ‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING
- [ ] I added any new issues I discovered
- [ ] I used verification language (no claims without proof)

### **AGENT_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md:**
- [ ] I logged what I actually accomplished (not what I attempted)
- [ ] I provided commit hashes for all code changes
- [ ] I documented any failures or partial fixes honestly
- [ ] I updated my final status

---

## üìã **STEP 3: VERIFY NO REGRESSIONS**

### **Test Critical Functions (Even if you didn't touch them):**
- [ ] Food analyzer still works (or is still broken as documented)
- [ ] Login flow works
- [ ] Dashboard loads
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Database queries work

### **If ANY of these are newly broken:**
- [ ] I documented the regression in CURRENT_ISSUES_LIVE.md
- [ ] I reverted my changes or fixed the regression
- [ ] I updated my status to "CAUSED REGRESSION"

---

## üìã **STEP 4: FINAL DOCUMENTATION**

### **In Your Final Response:**
```
EXIT VERIFICATION COMPLETED ‚úÖ

WHAT I ACTUALLY FIXED:
- [List only verified working items with proof]

WHAT I ATTEMPTED BUT FAILED:
- [List anything that didn't work]

REGRESSIONS CAUSED:
- [List any new issues I created]

CURRENT SITE STATUS:
- [Copy from CURRENT_ISSUES_LIVE.md]

PROOF PROVIDED:
- [List screenshots/evidence]

COMMIT HASH: [actual hash]
Date: [actual date from git]
```

### **Required Evidence:**
- [ ] Screenshots of working functionality
- [ ] Git commit hash (verified with git show command)
- [ ] Updated tracking files
- [ ] Honest assessment of what actually works

## üö´ **BANNED PHRASES - NEVER USE THESE:**

- ‚ùå "Should work now"
- ‚ùå "The fix has been deployed" (without testing)
- ‚ùå "This is now resolved"
- ‚ùå "The issue has been addressed"
- ‚ùå "I believe this is working"

## ‚úÖ **APPROVED PHRASES - USE THESE:**

- ‚úÖ "I tested this on live site and confirmed it works"
- ‚úÖ "I attempted to fix this but it's still broken"
- ‚úÖ "I verified this working with screenshot"
- ‚úÖ "I couldn't get this working in my session"

---

## üö® **FAILURE TO COMPLETE CHECKLIST = FAILED AGENT**

If you cannot complete this checklist:
1. **Don't claim to be done**
2. **Document what you tried**
3. **Leave clear instructions for next agent**
4. **Update CURRENT_ISSUES_LIVE.md with accurate status**

**This checklist prevents the hallucination problem you've experienced.**

# üö® MANDATORY AGENT PROTOCOL - COPY THIS TO EVERY NEW AGENT

```
CRITICAL ONBOARDING INSTRUCTIONS - READ EVERYTHING BEFORE STARTING

Hi, I'm working on my Helfi.ai project and need you to follow these MANDATORY protocols to protect my site from being broken by agents (which has happened too many times).

üö® BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING:
1. Read AGENT_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md to see what previous agents broke
2. Read SITE_HEALTH_CHECKER.md to understand critical functions
3. Update your agent number in AGENT_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md
4. Run a health check of the live site at https://helfi.ai

‚õî ABSOLUTE RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:
‚Ä¢ NEVER deploy anything until you tell me what you found and how you plan to fix it
‚Ä¢ NEVER claim something is fixed without testing it on the live site (https://helfi.ai)
‚Ä¢ NEVER break the food analyzer - previous agents destroyed the OpenAI API key
‚Ä¢ NEVER hallucinate commit information - use actual terminal commands to verify
‚Ä¢ ALWAYS provide commit hash in this EXACT format with copy button:

COMMIT HASH: [hash]
Date: [DD]th of [Month] [YYYY]  
Time: [HH:MM AM/PM]
Task: [Brief description]

üîç CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES:
‚Ä¢ Food analyzer is BROKEN (OpenAI API 401 errors)
‚Ä¢ API key was corrupted by previous agent (ends in ***0rUA instead of correct key)
‚Ä¢ Correct OpenAI key: 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

üìä MANDATORY PROCESS:
1. Health check ‚Üí Identify issues ‚Üí Get approval ‚Üí Make changes ‚Üí Test live site ‚Üí Provide commit hash
2. Log ALL activities in AGENT_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md
3. Never work on multiple things at once
4. Test every single change on https://helfi.ai immediately

üõ°Ô∏è PROTECTION SYSTEMS IN PLACE:
‚Ä¢ SITE_HEALTH_CHECKER.md - Tests all critical functions
‚Ä¢ AGENT_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md - Logs what every agent does
‚Ä¢ This protocol prevents the disasters caused by previous agents

üö® AGENT MEMORY/TOKEN MONITORING:
Signs you're running out of memory:
‚Ä¢ Responses become shorter/less detailed
‚Ä¢ You start forgetting earlier conversation context  
‚Ä¢ You begin repeating yourself
‚Ä¢ Complex reasoning becomes harder
If you notice these signs, tell me immediately so I can start a new agent.

‚ùó REMEMBER:
Previous agents broke my site by:
- Corrupting the OpenAI API key
- Making false claims about fixes
- Never testing on live site  
- Providing wrong commit information
- Breaking working features

Don't be another failed agent. Follow this protocol exactly.

Are you ready to proceed with this protocol? Confirm you understand before starting.
```

## üí° **HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT:**

1. **Copy the entire text above** (between the ``` markers)
2. **Paste it to every new agent** before giving them any tasks
3. **Wait for confirmation** they understand before proceeding
4. **Reference the protocol** if they start breaking rules

## üîÑ **UPDATING THE PROTOCOL:**

If you discover new issues or want to add protections:
1. Update this file
2. Use the updated version for future agents
3. Keep improving the protection system

# TODO_LIST

Last updated: 2025-08-28

How to use
- Keep this as the single source of truth for what to fix next
- We’ll update this list as items are fixed or new ones are found

Priority 3 — Nice to have / quality improvements

8) Improve multi-food analysis (salads, soups, stews, full dinners)
   - Current: Single foods are good; mixed meals are rough
   - Goal: Detect multiple items, estimate portions per item, and show a total

9) Recognize packaged products and return per-portion nutrition
   - Scenario: Photo of a supermarket product
   - Goal: Identify product, read label when possible, output 1-portion calories, protein, carbs, fat (and fiber/sugar if seen)

Notes
- We’ll keep this list short and plain-English
- When we fix an item, we’ll mark it “Done” here and move on to the next

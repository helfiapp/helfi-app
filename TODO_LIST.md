# TODO_LIST

Last updated: 2025-08-20

How to use
- Keep this as the single source of truth for what to fix next
- We’ll update this list as items are fixed or new ones are found

Priority 3 — Nice to have / quality improvements

7) Billing/credits: confirm limits and purchase flow
   - Pricing/limits changed over time
   - Goal: Check that daily limits and credit purchases behave as expected and show the right messages

8) Desktop: Finder “Downloads” window pops over browser (from screenshot)
   - Observed: A macOS Finder “Downloads” window overlays the site and blocks interaction
   - Goal: Identify trigger and prevent it (check OS auto-open settings, browser extensions, accidental shortcuts)

Notes
- We’ll keep this list short and plain-English
- When we fix an item, we’ll mark it “Done” here and move on to the next

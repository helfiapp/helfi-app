After pushing code to GitHub, ALWAYS run ./scripts/check-deployment-status.sh

The script will wait until deployment completes (READY or ERROR)

You have full access to Vercel via full access token so use it to view the deployment

NEVER report "deployment in progress" or "deployment building" to the user

ONLY report success when deployment state is READY

If deployment fails (ERROR state), fix the issue and redeploy before reporting

Read DEPLOYMENT_PROTOCOL.md and AGENT_START_HERE.md for full details

Before making ANY code changes:

- Read AGENT_START_HERE.md
- Read GUARD_RAILS.md (single source of truth for locked / stable sections)
- Do NOT modify any code listed as "locked" in GUARD_RAILS.md (e.g. Food Analyzer, food diary loading, credit/billing system) unless the user explicitly asks for that specific change in this chat
- If unsure whether an area is locked, ask the user for clarification BEFORE editing

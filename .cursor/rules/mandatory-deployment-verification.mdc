After pushing code to GitHub, ALWAYS run ./scripts/check-deployment-status.sh

The script will wait until deployment completes (READY or ERROR)

NEVER report "deployment in progress" or "deployment building" to the user

ONLY report success when deployment state is READY

If deployment fails (ERROR state), fix the issue and redeploy before reporting

Read DEPLOYMENT_PROTOCOL.md and AGENT_START_HERE.md for full details

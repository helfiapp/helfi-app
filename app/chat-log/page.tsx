              <p className="text-gray-700">Please read the project context file to view what the previous agent was working on. I had to get rid of him because he was saying that he had completed certain tasks and when I checked they were not actually completed. You have a full audit of all of the mobile phone issues but we are going to go step-by-step and do one issue at a time. Let me know when you've read the project file and please under no circumstance. Are you to break anything that has been already created and fixed in the project. Any fixes that you asked to do need to be done without affecting any other functionality or sections of the web application unless specifically asked to do so. Let me know when you have read everything and up-to-date.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-700">I read the PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file completely and understood the current project status, including what was working and must not be broken.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-700">Let's first work on priority one which is the drop-down navigation is completely broken and no matter which link you click. Nothing actually happens. One other thing I would like you to do for me is on the bottom navigation you can see we have reports I think traditionally it is better for us to have the settings page there rather than reports and maybe put reports in the drop-down navigation. I still however think that it's important to have all the sections in the bottom navigation also in the drop-down navigation. One of the thing that we need to change is place the insides tap in the bottom navigation in the drop-down menu and we need to have health info in place of the insights which actually takes you to the onboarding page. Once again, as I mentioned before, I would also like to see the health info, which is the on boarding section to also appear in the drop-down menu. Please let me know if you understand what I've said and if it's clear. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-700">Multiple clarifications were made about navigation structure, eventually settling on: Dashboard, Insights (renamed from Health), Profile, Health Info → Intake, Settings. User preferred "Intake" as a medical term for onboarding.</p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">"Actually stop" - "This is why it's imperative that I see the deployment to the server happen.

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-1">
                <li>✅ Fixed dropdown navigation click issue (missing dropdown-container class)</li>
                <li>✅ Changed "Health Info" → "Intake" in navigation</li>
                <li>✅ Fixed Insights page title: "Health Tracking" → "Insights"</li>
                <li>✅ Standardized Profile page header to match Insights design</li>
                <li>✅ Completely redesigned Account Settings page header + added missing bottom navigation</li>
                <li>✅ Added consistent bottom navigation to Settings page (was completely missing)</li>
                <li>✅ Properly deployed using `vercel --prod` command with user verification</li>

              <p className="text-gray-700">"That is correct so it should say instead of health tracking in the title at the top it should say insights. But here is the other problem. The design of the header section on this page needs to be implemented in all of the other pages as well.</p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">For example you have the settings page which also needs to look the same as far as design is concerned to the insights page. The profile page is very similar that you can see the word profile is not centered like the insights page. If you go to the account settings page that also looks a mess and needs to be set out exactly like the insights page. Furthermore on the account settings page the NAV bar down the bottom should not be disappearing. We also have the profile picture page which I would prefer if it's a profile photo and also upload profile photo instead of profile picture and once again the nav bar should not be disappearing down the bottom. Surprisingly, the subscriptions and billing page looks great in the header section, but once again the NAV bar should remain down the bottom and it's not there at the moment. The notifications page needs to have the header improved like the Insights page and also the navigation bar at the bottom needs to be present. The privacy settings page makes absolutely no sense whatsoever as it's showing privacy policy view our full privacy policy. If this is supposed to be a privacy settings page, it should allow you to set privacy settings so we might need to create a page for this and make sure if you do create a page that we have the navigation bar at the bottom. The help and support page needs to have the header look like the Insights page and the nav bar at the bottom. Do you understand and are you able to implement all of these changes?"</p>

## üìù **AGENT UPDATE LOG**

### **Agent #1 (Previous)**
- **Started**: July 1st, 2025
- **Tested**: Local dev environment startup, terminal logs, live API calls
- **Found**: Food analyzer API key definitely broken (401 errors in logs)
- **Attempted**: Multiple API key fixes, Vercel environment variable updates
- **Result**: ‚ùå FAILED - API key still invalid, still shows "AC8A" error in logs
- **Critical Issue**: Exhibited same problematic pattern as previous agents:
  - Made contradictory statements about API key correctness
  - Claimed fix was working, then said it was broken, then said to use original value
  - Went through repetitive cycle without actually resolving the core issue
- **Status**: üî¥ FAILED TO RESOLVE - Food analyzer remains broken
- **Next Agent**: Must get fresh API key from OpenAI dashboard - current one is definitively corrupted

### **Agent #2 (Current)**
- **Started**: July 1st, 2025
- **Tested**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED - Local curl tests and live site API calls
- **ACCOMPLISHED**: 
  - ‚úÖ FIXED LOCAL: Food analyzer working perfectly (returns real AI analysis)
  - ‚úÖ VERIFIED: Local API response: `{"success":true,"analysis":"Medium apple (1 whole) Calories: 95, Protein: 0.5g, Carbs: 25g, Fat: 0.3g"}`
  - ‚úÖ UPDATED: Local .env and .env.local files with new working API key
  - ‚úÖ DEPLOYED: Code changes and documentation to production
- **STILL BROKEN**:
  - ‚ùå LIVE SITE: Production still returns `{"error":"Failed to analyze food"}`
  - ‚ùå TESTING: Multiple curl tests to both helfi.ai and www.helfi.ai domains fail
- **STATUS**: üü° PARTIAL SUCCESS - Local fixed, production still needs work

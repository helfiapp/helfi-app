- Title: Onboarding modal + dashboard deferral (stable); back arrow links to dashboard; Google avatar domain retained
- Reason: First-time login flow confirmed working end-to-end without regressions. Modal appears for new users; “I’ll do it later” stays on dashboard; back button no longer bounces; left menu intact on app pages.

- Title: Onboarding modal + dashboard deferral (stable); back arrow links to dashboard; Google avatar domain retained
- Reason: First-time login flow confirmed working end-to-end without regressions. Modal appears for new users; “I’ll do it later” stays on dashboard; back button no longer bounces; left menu intact on app pages.

How to use
- When a new version is verified “golden”, update this file with the new commit hash, date, and a brief reason.
- Keep only the latest golden entry here; older golden points can be retrieved from git history if needed.
